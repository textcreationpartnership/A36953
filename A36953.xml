            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E being such a dull Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men, as I think the like was never heard of before; I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be many that take notice, as they ought, of that no less Pious than Ingenious Motto engraven under your Lordships Coat of
<pb facs="tcp:48913:4"/> Arms, <hi>DEUS NOBIS HAEC OTIA FECIT;</hi> which I would <hi>English</hi> thus in the Language of Scripture, <hi>This is the Lords doing;</hi> wherefore <hi>not unto us, O Lord, not unto us,</hi> but <hi>to thy Name give Glory;</hi> supposing your Lordship would have it understood chiefly in that sense, though not excluding the other, which it may have. As for me, My Lord, I make it the Ordinary Text of my Daily Meditations, and so I conceive every man in these three Nations ought to do, from him who is the supreme Head and Governour over all, to the meanest and most inconsiderable Member of the Body. Surely it is God that hath restored the King to his Throne, the Church to her Rights, the Parliament to their Priviledges and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the whole Nation to its true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And it is through the favour of that good, wise and just God, that now, in the head City of this Kingdom, where not long since <hi>Loyalty</hi> was <hi>Treason,</hi> and true <hi>Piety Superstition,</hi> I may freely and safely, not only speak but set forth my mind in Print, in behalfe of the <hi>CHURCH</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> under the Patronage of
<pb facs="tcp:48913:4"/> the Lord High Chancellor of the Realme.</p>
            <q>Deus nobis haec otia fecit.</q>
            <p>But yet, My Lord, although God be the principal Authour of this miraculous Restitution of all things amongst us, and his Invisible and Almighty Hand hath seldom appeared more visibly, or wrought more powerfully than in this most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed change, even to the astonishment of those that were Instrumental therein, who saw things succeed beyond their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and expectation, (and some perhaps beyond their wishes and intentions too:) yet I say, My Lord, some instruments there were which God was pleased to make use of for that great work. He that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God hath done the most in it, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt the King himself, though he had contributed thereunto but that high repute of Justice, Wisdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage, Constancy, and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd Goodness and Clemency, which His Majesty so deservedly acquired to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, even to admiration, during His af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, both abroad and at home, in the
<pb facs="tcp:48913:5"/> esteem of all men that observe His Royal Person, as well Enemies as Friends. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that high Heaven, that <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of all, there were less <hi>Orbs</hi> which moved their several wayes to attain this rest: And it cannot be denied but some of them have had very noble and succesful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the propitious influence whereof we now enjoy to our unspeakable comfort, and their immortal glory. But truly, My Lord, we should be unjust to him, who, under the Kings most Excellent Majesty, is the common and most impartial Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of Justice and Equity unto all in the Nation, if we did not acknowledge, that your Lordships part hath been the chiefest. For, although your Lordships place was such, as that by it, like the Spring in a Watch, which moveth all, &amp; is not so much as seen it self; your Lordship did act much more than the World knows, or is fit to be known, by reason of the mysterious managing of State-affairs; nevertheless we all know far more than, I am sure, your Lordships Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty will give us leave to speak. No man can be ignorant, that though the King is now
<pb facs="tcp:48913:5"/> the most accomplished Prince in the World, yet time there was that both His Age and the low Condition He was brought to, did need such a Wise and Faithful Counsellor, as the good Providence of God blessed Him with, when your Lordship was made to approach His Majesty. So great a <hi>Monarch</hi> was never put to so great straites. He was expelled His own Country, and bereaved of all, having not so much left as where to rest his Head in three great Kingdoms; and the might of His rebellious Subjects was come to such a height, that they thought themselves in a condition to say in <hi>Antichristian,</hi> that is, their own Language, <hi>We shall see no sorrow.</hi> And the truth is, they so long and so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully prospered, that in the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of most men, both Friends and Foes, at home and abroad, they were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as past all fear of being overthrown. Whence it was doubtless, that, most men being commonly led by their own Interest, His Majesty was so neglected for a long time by some of His Friends at home, and by His nearest Allies abroad. In that most sad and deplorable conjuncture, the King
<pb facs="tcp:48913:6"/> needed two men; the one a <hi>Terentius Varro, qui de Republica non desperavit,</hi> who when <hi>Hannibal</hi> was Master of all, yet was so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded of the good Fortune of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he did not despair to see her deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the hands of so powerful an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: the other a <hi>Fabius Maximus, qui cunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando restituit Rem,</hi> who by temporising, and watching prudently for a good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, shewing himselfe now and then to the Enemy, to let him know that he had yet an Opposite, at last overthrew him. The one to cherish and keep up the hearts of honest men; the other wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to improve all occasions to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>I may truly say, My Lord, that your Lordship was both a <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> and a <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> to His Majesty. Nay, I may say, that your Lordship did go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them both, as indeed the difficulties you had to overcome, and the enemies to encounter, were far greater. <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Varro</hi> is commended <hi>quod non desperave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> in that he did not despaire of the good Fortune of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:48913:6"/> that he did not precipitate any thing, but warily and patiently waited for favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Junctures and faire Opportunities of doing his business. But your Lordship did not onely, <hi>non desperare,</hi> not despaire, but alwayes <hi>bene sperare,</hi> hope well, nay, never so much as doubted of the good Fortune of <hi>England,</hi> that is, of the Kings Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of which your Lordship ever spoke as of a thing infallible, in the worst of times, and when it seemed scarce possible to any man. And it was ever your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships judgement, that time having made known the Usurpers, and brought the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a right understanding of themselves, all things would come about to that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed pass we see them now; That Subjects weary of being slaves under the vilest Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants that ever were, would remember the good Old Dayes; and knowing that they had a lawful Prince, whom God had adorned with such Royal Endowments as would certainly make them happy under his just Government, their own interest would force them to cast themselves down at His Majesties Feet, that they might
<pb facs="tcp:48913:7"/> have him to reign over them. So that it was chiefly required <hi>cunctare,</hi> to watch with Patience and Prudence, only letting the Rebels know, by appearing now and then, that they had a Master, who would call them one day to an account; And good Subjects, that they had a lawful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign, who was mindful of them. And thus it was, My Lord, that <hi>unus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo nobis,</hi> your Lordships most wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels by bringing in the King, and ending a long and most cruel Warre without bloodshed, did not only <hi>restituere,</hi> restore, but <hi>augere rem,</hi> encrease the glory and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Kingdom. For all which both we that are now alive, and they that shall succeed us in these now Fortunate Islands, must ever praise God and Honour your Lordships Name and Memory.</p>
            <p>One thing more, My Lord, was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the compleating of our happiness; That as our civil broyles ended peaceably, so our Controversies of Religion should be decided in the like manner, and our Temple built up anew, like that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> without <hi>any noyse of Hammer or Ax, or
<pb facs="tcp:48913:7"/> any other tool heard about it.</hi> And it is known to all, and to those very men, who I fear will at last be judged on all hands wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called the <hi>Sons of strife,</hi> how great and earnest your Lordships endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been, to bring all such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to an happy issue, nothing being more dear to your Lordship than the Peace of the Church. But as God when he had brought the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> into the promised Land, left amongst them some of the old Inhabitants, to be as <hi>Thorns in their sides;</hi> so it seemes he is pleased in his Wisdome that some <hi>Canaanites,</hi> I mean some <hi>Zelots,</hi> should still remain in this Land whither he hath brought his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple back, to be incentives to set us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in well-doing. Nevertheless I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it the duty of all those who love the peace of the Church, to contribute what they can to procure it. Hence it is, My Lord, that I have endeavoured to do something that way, by shewing them who are not satisfied with our <hi>Church-Government</hi> and <hi>Publick Worship by Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,</hi> That they are the onely men in
<pb facs="tcp:48913:8"/> the World of all those that profess the Protestant Religion, who scruple to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the one, and joyn with us in the other; And that if they refuse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in all those things which are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by lawful Authority upon all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> they must likewise renounce the Communion of all other Reformed Churches, there being not one in all the World, but doth impose things of like nature, against which the same Exceptions may be made with as much reason; nay all and every one of those Ceremonies which are here impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, being also imposed in one or other of the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas; and all and more, in some of them, which yet are not therefore accounted Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious in the judgement of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which do not use the same.</p>
            <p>Now, My Lord, many Reasons there are which have moved me to set forth this <hi>Essay</hi> of mine under your Lordships Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. First, I certainly know that any thing tending to Peace and Unity in the Church, is most welcome to your Lorship. Next,
<pb facs="tcp:48913:8"/> though I confess that it is too mean a thing to be offered to a Person in so high a Place yet that great Bounty and Kindness of your Lordship, whereof I have so often had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience beyond the Seas, being nothing altered now at home; And that Prosperity wherewith God hath blessed your Lordship, both in your Personal, so well deserved Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and in your Royal Alliance by that most accomplished Princess with one of the most Illustrious Princes under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, having not rendred your Lordship in any thing more haughty or less accessible, but that you are still the same to all your Servants; it might be thought an injury to your Lordship to entertain the least doubt, that it would not be acceptable by reason of its meanness. But the chiefest Reason I have, My Lord, is this, that it being my intention to contribute something towards the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those that stand yet at a distance from our Church, to a better understanding of her, and so to full Communion with her, I thought that I was to prefix no other name to my Work, but such an one as might be well liked of them all; And such is I
<pb facs="tcp:48913:9"/> conceive, or ought to be, your Lordships Name, unless they be the most ungrateful of all men. But I have trespassed upon your Patience and against the Publick Interest, by detaining your Lordship so long, for which I crave your pardon, humbly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leave to entitle my selfe thus publickly with all due respect,</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48913:14"/> touching these matters; That they blame the same things which they themselves find fault with in our Church; That no such things are practiced in any other Reformed Churches; And that the said Churches are no less zealous then they to have the Church of <hi>England</hi> Reformed after the pattern of their new Reformation here amongst themselves. And they have delivered this their Assertion with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that they have therein gained belief, not only from the simpler sort of their Disciples, but likewise from many of their Adversaries here in <hi>England,</hi> and from most of the Protestants abroad at first, till they were better informed; nay, to our amazement, themselves seem to have been so perswaded, though there is no such thing at all, as I shall undoubtedly make it appear by this following Treatise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Through this their pretended conformity with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in forraign parts, they endeavoured to get credit both abroad and at home. And the truth is, that for a time they missed not of their aim. But our Brethren of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches beyond the Seas have long since been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived by those whom God was pleased to disperse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, during the late captivity of this Church, and usurpation of His Majesties Authority. Nevertheless divers of our English Brethren, and likewise some of the best and most obedient Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> continue still in the same mistake. Wherefore I hope that by clearing it, I shall oblige them both, at least I shall displease neither. I speak of them both as being in one common error. For so indeed they are; but with this difference, that the <hi>anctent Protestants</hi> have been deceived by the <hi>new Presbyterians,</hi> and the Presbyterians have deceived themselves.<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, I will shew by the same evidences that in those things in which they differ from our Church, they do not condemn her, nor pretend we should rather conform to them then they to us: and that they never desired the abolition of our Church-Government, or of our Book of Common Prayer, but that they approve of both, and wish we may ever enjoy the benefit of both in peace and quietness; and that, besides the aforesaid evidences, by many private Letters written of late, by the most renowned, pious, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministers that are now living in the <hi>French</hi> Reformed Churches, and at <hi>Geneva.</hi>

                     </note> against all reason. For it is known of all who have enquired after it, that in the <hi>Protestant Cantons of Switzerland,</hi> there is a Subordination amongst their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, <hi>viz.

No <hi>Ministers</hi> in any of these Churches ought to be ordained, according to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48913:16"/> Discipline, without the <hi>Inspector</hi> or <hi>Superintendent;</hi> and in some, the <hi>Superintendent alone</hi> gives the imposition of hands, without the assistance of other <hi>inferior Ministers</hi> (though cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before to have a part in the examination) which is a thing that the Bishops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> never do, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways call some of the inferiour Clergy to lay hands with them on the ordained Minister. And in those Countries where the Churches are so numerous, as to have many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents and Inspectors, they have their <hi>Superintendents</hi> and <hi>Inspectors General,</hi> who are as our Arch-Bishops, for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders sake.</p>

For though they have not perhaps so ample Revenues as some Bishops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because they do not live in so wealthy Countries as this, and under so potent and so liberal Princes as our Soveraign; or because some sacrilegious hands have shared with them; or because the Romish Bishops enjoy, if not all, yet the greatest part of Church-lands; as for example at <hi>Strasburg</hi> and at <hi>Basil:</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless they have all that which is essential to the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of true Bishops, <hi>viz.</hi> the power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> Nothing is done without them, and great respect is had to them. I remember that being at <hi>Basil</hi> not long agoe, the Superintendent of the Churches of that City and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory thereof, was called by the Ministers who were far el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (for he is not forty years old) <hi>Reverendus Dominus Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,</hi> as he is indeed worthy of great respect, having been chosen very young for his great worth and learning.</p>

And these <hi>Seniors</hi> have under them between twenty and thirty Churches, some more, some less.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This Episcopacy begun in the said Churches with Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and although they have had their <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> as well as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who because they loved to have the first places, endeavoured to overthrow their lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours by rising up against Episcopal <hi>Government,</hi> yet God was pleased to preserve it among them until this time. It was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in that part of <hi>Hungary</hi> that belongs to the Prince of <hi>Transylvania</hi> in the year 1613. <hi>Lucas Hodaci</hi> being then Bishop, the sixth they had since Reformation. One <hi>Emeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Vifalvi</hi> rose up against Episcopal Jurisdiction, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled much the peace of those Churches, who thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the judgment of <hi>David Paraeus,</hi> then Professor at <hi>Heidelberg</hi> in the Palatinate, received a notable Epistle from him, in confirmation of their <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and condemnation of the Schismatical fellow, who being delivered over to the secular power, died in prison. <hi>Transylvania</hi> it self was likewise troubled with dividing spirits, who having been
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48913:17"/> corrupted here in <hi>England</hi> where they lived during the late troubles, did fiercely attempt a change in Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. and the years following: But the most Illustrious Prince <hi>George Rakoczi</hi> the second, who was no less learned then valiant, knowing what sad events had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the like beginnings in these Kingdoms, did vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppose their designs. And it is very observable, that not long before by a singular Providence, that worthy Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Doctor <hi>Isaac Basier</hi> Prebend of <hi>Duresme,</hi> and Arch-Deacon of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> was intrusted with the Divinity Chair in the Schools; who joyning his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Princes authority, did contribute very much to the defeating of the Plot, having had many Disputations with the Schismaticks, both in Writing and in the presence of the whole Court, as well as in the publick Schools, and specially in the Synod held <hi>Anno</hi> 1657. at <hi>Marosvaharheli,</hi> where no less for the credit of our Church then for his own, he had the honour to be President. But again <hi>Anno</hi> 1659. When <hi>Achatius Barcsyai,</hi> the great Rebel (who sold Prince <hi>Rakoczi</hi> his lawful Master, unto the <hi>Turks,</hi> swearing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up unto them) had subjected almost all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Innovators brake out anew against Episcopacy; and the Tyrant to ingratiate himself with the multitude, did give his consent to erect <hi>Presbytery,</hi> a very considerable part of the Clergy for fear or favour, being drawn into the Faction. Yet notwithstanding they prevailed thus far, the Nobility joyning with such of the right Clergy as stood for the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Government, it was and is maintained until this day. But of all this and many other remarkable passages pertaining to the same Subject, we are to expect a better account of the learned Pen of the worthy Doctor, unto whom I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my self a Debtor, not only for most of these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which I had before, but by publick fame, but also for many observations in this Treatise, some of which he hath confirmed according to the information I had from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, and some he hath imparted anew. Onely before I proceed any further, I'le mind the Reader to observe how the spirit of division is like himself in every place, and how

                     <hi>Whereas the Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>numbreth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degrees of such as are bound to rule and govern the Churches, and saying himself,</hi> Eph. 4.11. <hi>He hath given some to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, some to be Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors, some Doctors for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, for the edification of the Body of Christ, &amp;c. And that the same Apostle,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. Tit. 1. <hi>doth mention Bishops and Presbyters; we also do acknowledge in our Churches these Orders and Degrees, in so much that we have certain Bishops, as also Presbyters, eminently so called, or Seniors, who ought to govern with certain Laws, the other Ministers of God and Pastors of Churches, so called in Scripture phrase.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. To these Churches that have Bishops, both name and thing, I must adde the Churches of the <hi>unity of the Bohemian Brethren</hi> (as they call themselves) who having Reformed the Christian Religion from Popery, above two hundred years ago, have always since had Bishops, both name and thing, until their last calamity which hapned about five years since, some of them being yet alive. And here I may not omit (though it had been doubtless observed by others before) to relate how sollicitous they were to have lawful Bishops over them. After a long time of persecution from them who were addicted to the <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Roman See;</hi> they resolved to quit all whatsoever they had,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48913:19"/> and retire into the woods and mountainous places and holes of the earth, that they might serve God with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and there keep themselves out of the way of their persecutors. But nothing so troubled them in this their sad condition, as when they thought, that they might come to want a lawful Ministry, after those faithful Ministers who took then the care of their souls, were deceased. For to expect till some that had the <hi>Romish Ordination,</hi> should come to them for the Gospels sake, was but a very uncertain hope; Therefore it was thought meet by them to settle an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among themsesves, and whilest there were yet alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them some men in Orders, that they should give <hi>Ordination</hi> to others, and these to others again from time to time,<note place="margin">Quassabat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimos metus, an satis legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma foret ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio, si Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, non vero Episcopus?

But though they were thus enclined, yet doubts and fears did arise in their minds, <hi>whether such an Ordination, by which a Presbyter and not a Bishop, should create another Presbyter, would be lawful; and how they should be able to maintain such an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as well against others, when opposed, as to their own people, if by them questioned.</hi> At last after the anxious deliberation of some years, there met <hi>Anno</hi> 1467. out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia</hi> about seventy men of chief note among them, who having offered up unto God their hearty Prayers with many tears, that it might please him to shew whether he liked their design, and whether it was a fit time for the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, they resolved to enquire of the will of God by casting Lots. Wherefore they chose out of themselves by plurality of Votes, nine men whom they judged most fit to be made Ministers; and having called in a Child, who knew not what they were about, they gave him twelve small pieces of Paper wrapt up, to give unto the nine elected men, each of them one. Of these twelve nine were left <hi>blanck;</hi> and in three of them only was written, <hi>EST, It is,</hi> viz. the will of God which they desired to know. Now it might have so hapned that every one of the nine should have had a <hi>blanck</hi> given him, without any thing written on it: which would have been taken for a sign of Gods denial. But it came to pass that the three written Notes were delivered to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48913:19"/> three of them, <hi>viz. Matthias Kunwaldius, Thomas Prelaucius,</hi> and <hi>Elias Krenovius,</hi> the first a very <hi>Pious,</hi> the second a very <hi>Learned,</hi> the third a very <hi>Active</hi> man, all three very worthy persons, though each of them in a several way. Great was the joy of the whole company to see the Lots so happily fallen; and the three elected Ministers were received by the rest of their Brethren, as if they had been sent down from Heaven to them; But they were still at a stand about their Ordination, till they heard that there were some of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> whither they were fled for conscience sake. Thither they sent one <hi>Michael Zambergius,</hi> a Minister, with two others, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with their condition, and with what passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them about the election of their Ministers; and having found <hi>Stephanus</hi> their Bishop, after they had imparted to each other their sufferings, and declared their Faith and Doctrine; the said <hi>Michael Zambergius</hi> with his two Collegues were consecrated Bishops by <hi>Stephanus</hi> and another Bishop, with some Ministers whom they called and joyned with them in that work, and so returned home with Episcopal power; which was by them transmitted to their Successors until this day.</p>

As for the Churches of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the others that have an equality amongst their Ministers, I shall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the second Section, that they are no enemies to Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government. The <hi>French Churches</hi> I am certain are so far from any averseness to it, that they rather wish they were in a condition to enjoy that sacred Order, and to reap the benefit that may come to the Church of God through the same; all understanding men amongst them saying plainly, That <hi>if God Almighty were pleased that all</hi> France <hi>should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Reformed Religion, as</hi> England <hi>hath, the Episcopal Government must of necessity be established in their Churches;</hi> as now the equality of their Ministers,<note place="margin">Set Forms of Prayer and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies in all R formed Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48913:21"/> to see and to hear what is done there; that by the practise (which is the best Commentary upon Rubriks) he might better understand than he doth the meaning of those few he quoted.<note place="margin">In his V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And if any one should happen to be so unwise and so peevish as to blame and reject them, or so self-conceited with his gift of prayer as to presume to begin Divine Service with an extemporary Confession of sins, or an other kind of prayer of an hour long, instead of that short one which they use <hi>alwayes, and no other,</hi> it would not be suffered. Witness that which happened lately at <hi>Geneva,</hi> in the <hi>Germane</hi> Church there. A <hi>Tigurine</hi> Minister who was ordered to preach to that Congregation, being observed not to rehearse the Creed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the Morning prayer, as the custom is with them, was presently questioned for it. By which you may see that the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> is as strict for the using and imposing of her set forms as the Church of <hi>England</hi> ever was. And before I end this Section I will produce one of the Canons of the French Reformed Churches, by which all such as question the use of the set forms of their Liturgy, and who will not rest satisfied after a fair hearing, ought to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Nay, they are so far from affecting a variety of new conceived prayers every time they pray, that though they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48913:22"/> have liberty by one of their Rubricks to use what words they please in that prayer which is to go immediately before the Sermon, in which they ought not to expatiate, as the use is here among some men, but only to call for Gods blessing upon their preaching; there is not one Minister in all <hi>France</hi> but hath made unto himself a set form, which he useth alwayes, and no other. Now besides what I have already said of the practise of the said Churches, I may produce the testimony of a man of great worth and fame amongst them, the Learned and Eloquent <hi>Monsieur Martel,</hi> Minister in the Church of <hi>Mont-Alban,</hi> and Divinity-Reader in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; who in a Letter I received from him, about a year agoe, after he had testifyed his joy for the most happy Restauration of His Majesty, being solicitous also for our Church, hath these very words you read in the margin, which I translate thus; <hi>I wonder to hear that some are found in</hi> England <hi>that are altogether averse from any set forme of Laturgy to be observed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally one and the same in all the Kingdome.</hi>

They do the like at <hi>Roan,</hi> at <hi>Caen,</hi> and, I suppose, in all other Churches where there are many Ministers. But I speak only of what I have seen and practised my self. For what do I make this observation? to shew that the Reformed Churches abroad do not count it superstition for Ministers to change their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary apparrel, and to take another more decent, when they are to perform Divine Service. Nay in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> when there is a burial, the Minister must take his Gown: And when a Minister is buried, the neighbour Ministers that be present,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48913:25"/> must all have their Gowns, if Gowns can conveniently be had. Now this changing of apparrel for Divine Service is the very same thing for which the Church of <hi>England</hi> is by some men reputed Popish and Superstitious, when she will have her Ministers to wear <hi>Surplices</hi> upon the same occasions. For I hope that the pretended Popery and Superstition is not in the colour of the apparrel, but in the changing of it. Of which Popery and Superstition the French Reformed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are as guilty as the Protestant Ministers of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I am not ignorant that some say that Ministers should not wear white, because the Romish Priests use to wear that colour and abuse it, when they say their <hi>Mass.</hi> But do not they wear <hi>black</hi> also? Are there not <hi>black Fryers</hi> as well as <hi>white?</hi> and do they not abuse <hi>black</hi> in their <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> life?</p>
                  <p n="22">22.

I have already observed, that before the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Psalms</hi> Printed at <hi>Geneva</hi> for the use of that Church, in the embleme of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion,</hi> she is represented <hi>leaning upon a Cross;</hi> and that in <hi>France</hi> and other parts the Reformed have set up <hi>Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> upon their <hi>Churches,</hi> with the intent doubtless to declare that in those places <hi>Christ crucified</hi> is worshipped, and that they are consecrate to the service of that good God, who died for mankind upon the <hi>Cross.</hi> Let any man judge by this, whether it is likely that such as do not think the Christian Religion sufficiently represented without the figure of a <hi>Cross,</hi> and who set up <hi>Crosses</hi> upon their Churches for a token that they are Christian Churches, should disallow that the <hi>sign of the Cross</hi> be made upon <hi>newly baptized Infants,</hi> in token that they are Christians, received into the Congregation of Christs flock, and (as it is in the Office of Baptisme) <hi>that hereafter they shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> It is known how frequent the use of it is among them who follow the Confession of <hi>Augsburgh,</hi> not only in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> but upon other occasions. Nevertheless the National Assembly of the <hi>French</hi> Reformed Churches hath declared,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48913:34"/> (as was observed before) that <hi>there is no superstition in their worship.</hi> And therefore the Reformed Ministers who live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among them in <hi>Prussia,</hi> when they preach in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to a mixt congregation, partly <hi>Lutheran</hi> and partly <hi>Calvinist,</hi> do make sometimes the sign of the Cross with their hand in the aire when they give the blessing to the people, saying, <hi>The Lord be with you,</hi> as well as the <hi>Augustan</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>

Secondly, they disprove the Cross in Baptisme, because they conceive (though without any ground or reason) that it is an addition unto it: And so are the two last sprinklings of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which do twice over again that which hath already been done sufficiently the first time; if the Baptisme of this our Church and of the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> which is done at once, be sufficient, as doubtless it is, and is so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accounted all the world over. And I am confident that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be blamed for doing the same things for which other Churches are not so much as taken notice of, if the <hi>trina aspersio</hi> were used in it, or if she had retained the <hi>trine immersion,</hi> as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. his Reign, it would be counted a great superstition,<note place="margin">The Ministers taketh in his arms the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants when he baptiseth them.</note> though nothing is said against other Churches for their using of the same.

                     <hi>the custom in old time that the Children of Christian parents, when they were grown to the age of adolescence, should be presented to the Bishop, that they might perform that which was required of them who presented themselves to Baptisme when they were men of age. For such did sit among the Catechumenes, till they being rightly instructed in the mysteries of the faith, were able to utter before the Bishop and the people the Confession of their faith. Wherefore such as were baptised in their infancy, because they did not then make a confession of their faith before the Church, at the end of their infancy, or at the beginning of their adolescence, were again presented to the Bishop, and were by him examined according to the Catechisme which they had then in a certain set form. Now that this act, which otherwise was to be with good reason grave and holy, might be had in greater reverence and honour, the Ceremony of imposition of hands was used in it. And so the youth, after the approbation of his faith, was dismissed with a solemn blessing. The Ancients do often mention this custom, &amp;c. Therefore I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and praise such an imposition of hands, which is used simply
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48913:35"/> as a blessing, and I would that the practice of it were at present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to its pure use.</hi> And after he hath confuted the abuses of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about Confirmation, he addeth, <hi>But would to God that the custom which I said was in use among the Ancients, were by us retained, &amp;c.</hi>

So that the receiving of the Communion enabling us for the spiritual warfare,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48913:38"/> if a godly man being upon departing out of this life, and desiring to arm himself against all those temptations wherewith he may be compassed and assaulted, shall he be denied this singular great help through which he will with more chearfulness encounter the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and get the victory over him?</hi> Moreover saith he, <hi>The Lords Supper being a badge of that Ʋnion which is among the Sons of God, it would be very hard, and of very ill example, if one having been long sick in a Bed, or being near death should be hindred from professing and testifying his piety and agreement with the Church.</hi> But notwithstanding he was so well grounded in this, he could not prevail so much as to have it used in the Church of <hi>Geneva;</hi> where he found opposition against many other wholsome things, whereof some have been before observed, as occasion was. And though the French Reformed Churches do not use the same, because they are not permitted to exercise their Religion but in some certaine publick places appointed by their Kings authority, they are so far from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Church, or any other who give that ghostly Comfort to such as desire it, that their Ministers openly declare and profess they would do the like if they were permitted.

                  <p n="63">63. By what hath been said hitherto, I hope it is clear that the Government and Rites &amp; Ceremomies of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church of <hi>England</hi> are not so unknown and unpractised in the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas as was pretended, there being indeed hardly one of her Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that is not used in some one Reformed Church or other.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. But a main point,<note place="margin">Uniformity in every Reformed Church.</note> in which they all and every one agree at full together with her, is that of <hi>Ʋniformity.</hi> None of them doth intend to prescribe or impose any thing upon other National Churches, as shall appear in the second Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Treatise. For they know that it is not necessary that all National Churches should use the same Rites and Ceremonies. And though it is to be wished it might be so, for the greater unity of Christians one with another. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, as that Universal Uniformity hath never been yet, it may be counted in a manner a thing of a moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility. But that every National Church ought to have Uniformity within it self, it hath alwayes been the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all sober and wise Christians, and is at this day the good example of all the Reformed Churches in the world, (as much as their condition will bear it) except the now, as to that, yet unhappy Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nay those very men who at this time are so much against Uniformity in this Church, because they do not see themselves in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to force all others to conform to them, were as much for it, not very many yeares since, as any of those with whom they are displeased for pressing the same upon them now. Witnesse the Ordinance of the Lords and Commons 3. <hi>January</hi> 1644. <hi>for establishing and observing the Directory in all exercises of the publick Worship of God in every Congregation, Church, Chappel and place of publick Worship within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48913:40"/> of England, &amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>Preface</hi> of the said Directory, wherein the Authors acknowledge <hi>they have promised Ʋnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Divine Worship in their solemn League and Covenant.</hi> And I would it were out of mans memory how they dealt with them who were the then <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and who would not violate a Law Established by Act of Parliament and confirmed by a long, continued and general practise, and forswear themselves, to comply with the times. Take a view of all the <hi>Canons</hi> and Ecclesiastical <hi>Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Injunctions</hi> of any Reformed Church, and you will find that they are to be obeyed by all and every Member of the said Church, whether Minister or others, every one according to his place and calling. If every Member of this Church would but yield the same obedience to the Rulers thereof, that is yielded to the Rulers of other National Churches by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Members, we should see in a very short time, through the blessing of the God of Peace and Order, all things quiet and secure with great happinesse in this Nation. For indeed nothing more is by them demanded of any of those whom the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Constitutions of this Church,</hi> and the <hi>Lawes of the Land</hi> have put under their subjection. And can therebe any reason why disobedience, schisme and <hi>Independency</hi> should be suffered in the Church of <hi>England</hi> rather than in any other Reformed Church? I will instance here but in what is done in the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> about the great point of Uniformity, because they are best known here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. No man is to be ordained a Minister, nor admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any other Office in the said Churches,<note place="margin">Subscription required.</note> but he must <hi>subscribe,</hi> besides the publick Confession of their faith, the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> agreed upon at <hi>Paris, Anno</hi> 1559. which they call their <hi>Discipline.</hi>

But being they were to constitute one National Church with them, they would have them conform, or leave them to themselves as they were before the Principality of <hi>Bearn</hi> was incorporated to the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> In the said Acts also, among many others to the same purpose, there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry markable one to shew how zealous they are to keep Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity amongst themselves. For whereas there were a few Churches which did receive the holy Communion sitting, it was ordered by the National Assembly of St. <hi>Maixant,</hi> that the said Churches should conform to the others which use to receive it standing.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48913:41"/> The Consistory of the place shall endeavour to appease all without noise, and with all meekness of the word of God. And if those who contradict be not willing to acquiesce, the Consistory of the place shall pray the</hi> Classis <hi>to assemble at the fittest time and place, having first required of the gainsayers an express promise, and that recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they shall not in any way or manner whatsoever spread any thing of their opinion, under pain of being censured as Schismaticks, save only that they may communicate with the Ministers and Elders, if they have not been instructed. And in case that the said gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers refuse to give the said promises, they shall be censured as Rebellious, according to the Discipline. And the</hi> Classis <hi>being assembled, shall proceed as abovesaid. And if the said gainsayers, being heard patiently, and confuted, remain satisfied, the whole business shall be recorded; otherwise the Provincial Synod shall be required to assemble in extraordinary, if need be, at the time and place that the said</hi> Classis <hi>shall think fittest, the abovesaid promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reiterated by the said gainsayers. The Synod being assembled first of all shall advise and consider with mature deliberation about the matter, place, time and persons, whether it shall be convenient the said dispute be had with the said gainsayers before the people openly, and whether any one of them that shall be present, and that have a mind to speak, shall be heard; provided always that no body shall have power to decide but such as are called of the Province, according to the Discipline. And then if the said gainsayers will not be ruled, they shall make anew the same promises as before, and shall be referred to the National Synod ordinarily, or if the case requireth it, extraordinarily assembled, which shall give them a holy and free hearing. And there shall be the full and final resolution out of the word of God; unto which if they refuse to acquiesce punctually, and with an express renunciation of their errors recorded, they shall be cut off from the Church.</hi> Thus the French Reformed Churches usually proceed against the disturbers of their setled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and publick Worship. And so indeed ought to do all National Churches that have a mind to preserve peace and unity among themselves. But though this may seem hard to them who may be concerned in it, yet if they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the thing in it self, laying aside all passion and private interest, they would think it most rational and just. For

                     <hi>The mean while I can give the Brethren no other advise but this, that they admonish your Collegue before the Magistrate, that he suffer himself to be ruled. If he continueth obstinately to refuse to do so, let them declare unto the party that they hold him no longer for their Brother, since he overthroweth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Discipline by his contumacy. This hath been alwayes of force in the Church, as being ordained by the Decrees of ancient Councils, that he who will not subject himself to the Lawes of common Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline should be deposed from his office. And there is no need here to seek for humane Authority, since the holy Ghost hath pronounced of such, that the Church hath not accustomed to be contentious.

                  <argument>
                     <p>That in those things, in which some Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, differ from the Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> they do not pretend she should rather conform to them, then they to her; and that they never desired the abolition of our Church-Government, or of our Book of Common-Prayer, but that they approve of both, and wish we may ever enjoy the benefit of both in peace and quietness.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter I had finished the first <hi>Section</hi> of this Treatise, there came forth in Print a thing called, <hi>A Petition for Peace, &amp;c.</hi> In which I find that the Authors thereof do still continue to alledge as a main reason, to excuse their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>the publick worship of God,</hi> by Law established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That, <hi>the Pastors of most of the Reformed Churches abroad take the conformity with us,</hi> in those things that they themselves dislike and scruple at, <hi>to be a sin:</hi> which is the same, as when they said in their Preface to the <hi>Directory,</hi> that the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> kept the said Churches from full Communion with us, and us with them. And this they affirm anew, with as much confidence, as if it were not only most true, but most evident, and so out of question, that it needeth not to be proved. For they do not so much as bring any one evidence for it, but only say, that so it is; taking it for a thing granted on all sides, and commonly known of every body. This, without all doubt, will seem very strange to many, to me it doth not: For although the said Assertion be as far from Truth, as Heaven is far from Earth; they have given it out for true so often since the first time, that now it is very likely they take it really to be true; whereas at first they either knew it to be most false, as it is; or (as I am more apt to believe) they delivered it rashly upon mis-information, or upon very light grounds. Now
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48913:43"/> this is the unhappinesse of all such as use themselves to speak an untruth, or venture to affirm any thing rashly; that though at first they are conscious of the Truth, and know very well how things stand, or at least have some doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same, yet notwithstanding, by telling them over and over again to others whom they would deceive, at last they are also deceived themselves. And I am heartily sorry that such a misfortune should befall tender <hi>Consciences,</hi> who profess the love of Truth, and who therefore should be (as I wish they were) sincere lovers of it, when known to them. My work therefore in this <hi>Section,</hi> must be to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Reformed Churches abroad from this scandalous aspersion, and to bring our deceived Brethren out of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in this point, as I hope I have done in the former; by shewing that the said Churches are no <hi>Enemies</hi> (as I have shewed they are no <hi>Strangers</hi>) to our Church-Government and Publick Worship of God.</p>

Can they bring any Article of the <hi>Publick Confession of Faith</hi> of any Reformed Church, whether of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> or <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Lithuani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> or of <hi>Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Transylvania,</hi> or of the Cities of <hi>Bremen</hi> and <hi>Embdem:</hi> or of <hi>Hessen:</hi> or the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> or of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> that are in the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or in either of the <hi>Silesia's,</hi> or of the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland:</hi> or of <hi>Holland, France, Geneva,</hi> and the <hi>Grisons?</hi> Can they shew us any of their <hi>Ecclesiastical Injunctions,</hi> or any <hi>Rubrik</hi> of their Books of Common Prayer, or of any other of their <hi>libri Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolici;</hi> wherein the received opinions of the several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the afore-named Countries, are contained and made publick to the world; by which it appeares that they would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48913:44"/> have us conform to them, in those things in which we differ from them, as they do themselves one from another, and that they take conformity therein with us to be a sin?

                     <note place="margin">The general si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches about those things in which they differ from us, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument that they do not condemn the said things as sinful.</note>3. This general silence of all the Reformed Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, is a sufficient argument to vindicate them from that scandalous aspersion of being Enemies both of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Rites of the Reformed Church of <hi>England.</hi> For sure they are not so uncharitable, if they should see us their Brethren in a way of sin, as not to advertise us of it, and to recall and bring us back from it. And if they did so little regard the salvation of our souls as to neglect us wholly; yet knowing that many of their Members come over to us and conform with us, in several parts of this Kingdom, they ought in conscience to forewarne them of our ill wayes; if they are persuaded we have any such, and forbid them to conform and comply with our pretended sins. And where could they have given this necessary <hi>Caveat,</hi> and made this prohibition more fitly and more profitably, than in some of their publick Records, that none might pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereof? No doubt therefore, but that they approve of those things which they no way nor any where condemn, or at least that they do not take them to be sinfull, but hold them to be of themselves simply indifferent, as indeed they are (I speak of outward Rites) and good only in the good use of them; and in reference to the good end for which they are instituted, and to the honouring and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as duty requireth) the lawful Authority by which they are enjoyned and imposed.</p>

When they return to their several Countries and Churches, none of them is questioned for having conformed with us. Of this I could produce many hundred witnesses, but I will name only one, who is a man beyond all exception in this matter; and that is Dr. <hi>John Colladon,</hi> one of the Kings Physitians in Ordinary, born in the <hi>Town</hi> and bred up in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and known for a sound <hi>Protestant,</hi> and who had the Honour to congratulate His Majesties most happy Restauration from the City and Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and from the Protestant Cantons of <hi>Switzerland.</hi> Enquire of him and he will tell you, that when he came over into <hi>England,</hi> not knowing whether there would be a French Church in those parts of the Kingdom or City, where his occasions might oblige him to settle and abide; before he parted, being not fully informed what the judgement of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> was about the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he put this <hi>Quaere</hi> to the Rulers of his said Church; whether it was lawful for him to joyn with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, and receive the holy Sacrament according to the usual Rites thereof? It was answered that he might, and that it was not to be questioned.

This I profess that I have done sometimes my self, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out benefit, when I studied Divinity at</hi> London <hi>and at</hi> Oxford. And who knoweth not that the famous <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> did conform in every thing to the Church of <hi>England</hi> when he was in the <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whereof he was made <hi>Prebendary</hi> by King <hi>James.</hi> I might adde Dr. <hi>de Laune</hi> Minister of the <hi>Walloons Church</hi> at <hi>Norwich,</hi> who speaking both languages performed often Divine Service in English Congregations, according to the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And Reverend Mr. <hi>Calendrin</hi> one of the Ministers of the <hi>Dutch Church</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and many more who have done the like upon occasions. All this, I trust, is somewhat towards the proving that the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches</hi> do not take the conformity with the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a <hi>sin,</hi> and I hope the impartial Reader will give more credit to what the said <hi>Pastors</hi> say of themselves, and of the judgment and practice of their own men, and to what he seeth himself that they do, then to what some men talk of them without any ground or colour of reason.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But it will he said perhaps (as men are ingenious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves) that when those of the Reformed Churches abroad joyn with us here in <hi>England</hi> in our publick worship of God, it is for want of other Congregations with which they might joyn. But this cannot reasonably be excepted against by the instances I now made; not against that of <hi>Monsieur Bochart</hi> who speaks of his joyning with us in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48913:45"/> Service of our Church, as well when he was at <hi>London,</hi> where there is a French Church, as when he was at <hi>Oxford</hi> where there is none; nor against those of the others afore-named: the two last Doctor <hi>de Laune,</hi> and Master <hi>Calandrin,</hi> being ordinary Preachers to two several Congregations, one of <hi>Walloons,</hi> the other of <hi>Dutch.</hi> There was likewise a <hi>Walloon</hi> Church at <hi>Canterbury</hi> for Doctor <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> to joyn with. And suppose there had been only such want of other Congregations, what reason had that been for them to joyn with us in a <hi>sinful</hi> worship, if they had thought ours to be such? There can never be any reason to comply with sin. Besides that <hi>Monsieur Bochart</hi> saith, that it is an usual thing for those of the Reformed Churches, when they have attained the knowledge of the English Tongue, to come to our Churches, and that not for want of a better, or out of any constraint, but <hi>libenter, of their own accord, and willingly.</hi>

That some may be found notwithstanding this, and they Ministers perhaps as well as others in the Reformed Churches abroad, who out of a <hi>froward, peevish,</hi> and <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> humour (as <hi>Ludovicus Capellus</hi> saith of the English <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>) or because they are in love with those things to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48913:47"/> which they are accustomed; or that they are mis-informed, knowing only so much of our Church, as is represented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by partial hands, and by such as make it their work to <hi>disfigure</hi> us, and to make us odious to our Brethren. That, I say, some may be found in the Reformed Churches abroad, who upon these and the like grounds, or out of some weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of judgement and distemper of mind, do over-value their own way, even to the vilifying of all others, and think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so well as what they are used to, wishing thereupon, that all the world would follow it, I nothing doubt. For there is <hi>ignorance, weakness,</hi> and <hi>humour</hi> in other Countries, as well as in <hi>England.</hi> And there is never a National Church in Christendom, wherein there are not some Members that find fault with one thing or other of the Government and publick Worship thereof: whence it is, that every Church hath made Laws very strict against such contentious unquiet Spirits to suppress them, as I have shewed out of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>French</hi> Reformed Churches. But as the peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the fantastical opinions, and rash speeches of such men against the Government and Worship of their own Churches, cannot be imputed to the said Churches which are thereby disturbed; neither ought we in justice and reason to ascribe to any of the Reformed Churches the impertinent and foolish talking of any of their men, if peradventure some be found (which I am confident are very few) that dare speak any thing against the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And this ought we the less to do for that when their Synods have notice given them of such senseless brain-sick fellows, a censure is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with passed upon them for their scandalous rashness. Of this their wise and Christian-like proceeding in such cases, I'le bring one instance here, which I trust, will be found to the purpose, and this it is: One Mr. <hi>Coignart</hi> of the Town of <hi>Roan,</hi> first a <hi>Physician,</hi> next a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> then a <hi>Divine,</hi> writ a Book of Controversie against the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Book had many good things in't, and that the man was not rich, he had a summe of money allowed him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Printing of the same, as the custom is in like cases: When the Work was out in Print, he presented his Petition
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48913:47"/> to the Synod of the Province, that he might receive the summe of money appointed for him. Whereupon complaint being made of some scandalous expressions of his Book, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> those whose Office it was to examine Books before they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed for the Press, were called in question. One of them being present, by name <hi>Monsieur de l'Angle,</hi> President of the Assembly, protested that he advised <hi>Coignart</hi> to take out of his said Book those scandalous expressions against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that he gave him Licence to put forth his Book, but upon condition he should do so; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving failed to do, his opinion was, that <hi>Coignart</hi> instead of receiving the summe which formerly was promised him, should be censured by the Synod; which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, every one of the Assembly approving and following the Overture made by the Moderator thereof. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 1657. When the Church of <hi>England</hi> did lie as it were <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>buried,</hi> and in the apprehension of most men, almost out of hope of a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which is worthy observation: the Synod was held at <hi>Caën</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> in the house of the afore mentioned <hi>Monsieur Bochart.</hi> I was present at it, being sent thither from My Lord <hi>Duc de la force,</hi> whose Chaplain I was at that time. <hi>Monsieur le Couteur</hi> the now worthy Dean of the Island of <hi>Jersey,</hi> being then one of the Ministers of the Reformed Church of <hi>Caën</hi> was there likewise. We both rejoyced exceedingly to see so much right done to our Church, notwithstanding her low condition, and that so handsomely, so unanimously, in such a juncture of affaires, and with so little ado on our part, that though we were not wanting to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in representing the wrong done to our Mother-Church, we were conscious that the whole Assembly, one of the most considerable of all <hi>France,</hi> both for the number and for the worth of the Members thereof, did do nothing in that but what was according to their usuall known Principles, without any the least regard to us.</p>

                        <p>I Think I have told you by my former Letters that I rejoyced very much at the establishement of the <hi>Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-Gallicane</hi> Church that the King your Soveraign hath
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48913:48"/> made, wherein his Majesty hath ordered you to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. And I rejoyced speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the scope of that set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, <hi>viz.</hi> To make known to the whole world that Communion which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of <hi>France</hi> have not that aversion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which some men report they have. I am certain that my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues were of the same mind when I imparted unto them the news of your new established Church, and we are all still of the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I marvel that any one dare tell you that I have changed my opinion, and that I do approve of what some give out concerning those of the French Church of <hi>London;</hi> (and which to say the truth, I cannot believe) that they make difficulty to entertain Communion with you when any occasion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. I hold them to be wiser, and better enclin'd to peace then so. They know that the Illustrious <hi>Mousieur du Moulin</hi> the Father preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before King <hi>Iames,</hi> and that he received the Lords Supper at the same time that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48913:49"/> His Majesty did <hi>receive,</hi> as also some of the Bishops, to shew the Communion which is betwixt the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and our Churches; and that the things we differ in are but as the <hi>many colours of Ioseph's coat,</hi> our Doctrine being altogether the same. They know also that Dr. <hi>Primerose</hi> their late Pastor was at the same time one of His Majesties Chaplains. But if those of that Church were now of another mind, the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> are very far from approving of such scandalous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>

                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Primerose</hi> Grand-child to the afore named Dr. <hi>Primerose,</hi> who is at present one of the Ministers of the <hi>Walloons</hi> Church of <hi>London,</hi> is a person of so much worth and honesty, that I am sure he will not deny that he hath heard <hi>Monsieur de l'Angle</hi> say, that if any did refuse Communion with our Congregation, which is now a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he holds such for no other then <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> Before I have done I will shew that he is not alone of that opinion, but that it is the judgement of all understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men in the Reformed Churches abroad. Now whilest it comes into my mind, for fear I might forget it, I shall hear impart to the Reader what hath passed betwixt the two French Congregations that are within the two Cities of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Westminster;</hi> not to renew their ancient quarrels one with another, which are now composed; nor to blame ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; but only that it may be known on what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion and upon what ground one of them hath submitted to the Pastoral Care of the right Reverend Bishop of <hi>London,</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:48913:49"/> and taken up the use of the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also a very considerable Argument to vindicate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Strangers from the imputation of being enemies, or any way averse to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and such a one doubtless, as would have hindred all men pretending to be rational and not prejudicate, from giving out so ill reports of them, but such only as think they know better the <hi>things of a man, then the spirit of man which is in him;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to be better informed of the judgement of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches beyond the Seas, than those who were born and bred up in them, and have been Ministers therein.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. About twenty years since the <hi>Duke of Soubize,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A whole French Reformed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation hath conformed to the Reformed Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
                     </note> living near the Court, and finding it troublesome, and sometimes unpossible for him, by reason of his infirmities, to go to Church as far as <hi>Thredneedle-street,</hi> where the <hi>Walloons</hi> have their Church, he had commonly a French Sermo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> preached before him in his own House every Sunday. Thither the French who live in those parts did usually resort, to save themselves the labour and toil of going up so great a way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City. This they found so commodious, that after the Duke was dead, they resolved to set up a French Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Strand,</hi> and wholly to leave going to that of the City, except such men as continued to pay their usual stipend (as some there were that did) towards the maintenance of their Ministers, and others sometimes upon occasion. But this notwithstanding, those of <hi>London</hi> so highly resented the erecting of that new Church, that ever since they endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all means possible to pull it down. Their last assault against the same was since the most happy restauration of this Church and Kingdom. For no sooner almost was the King returned, but they made their Addresses to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, to have the French Congregation of <hi>Westminster</hi> (for so it was called, as being within the Liberties thereof) broken and forbidden ever to Assemble any more thenceforth; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for reason of this their <hi>humble Petition</hi> and <hi>earnest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi> That the said Congregation was not established by any lawful Authority, and that by their Priviledge, all those of the French Language, wheresoever they lived, in either of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48913:50"/> Cities of <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Westminster,</hi> have but one only place, where they are permitted to assemble for the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in their own Tongue. They of <hi>Westminster</hi> to keep up their Congregation presented their humble suit to His Majesty, that he would be graciously pleased to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what trouble and toil it would be for them, especially such as had great Families, and young Children, to goe every Sunday to Church at such a distance. The King, all things considered, out of his wonted goodness, found out a way in his Wisdom, to grant them both their requests; by breaking the French Congregation of <hi>Westminster,</hi> according to the desire of those of the <hi>VValloons</hi> Congregation of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as being established indeed without any lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and by setting up a new Church under the immediate Jurisdiction of the right Reverend Father in God the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> wherein Divine Service should be performed in French, according to the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> by Law established in this Realm; His Majesty being graciously pleased to provide for the maintenance of a Minister, to be therein a constant Preacher; and leaving it to every ones Liberty to joyn with those of the old <hi>VValloons</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>London,</hi> or to become Members of the new <hi>French</hi> Church of <hi>VVestminster,</hi> which is likewise permitted by his Majesties gracious Letter, to adde to that Minister for whom his Majesty is to provide, as many others as by them shall be thought convenient for the advancement of Gods glory and their own edification, provided the said Ministers be presented to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, to be by him Instituted. His Majesties pleasure being thus to them signified, the Ministers and Elders, and the Heads of Families of the said Congregation met to advise together what was to be done: two or three (for I think there were no more) utterly refused to submit; and indeed their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age had been such during the troubles, that no other thing was to be expected from them. Of the others some few were of a mind that the Ministers and some of the Elders in the name of the whole Congregation should write beyond the Seas, to ask the judgement of the Divines of the Reformed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48913:50"/> Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> to know whether they might with a good conscience leave that <hi>Liturgy</hi> they had used hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and take that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> subjecting themselves to the Bishop of <hi>Londons</hi> Jurisdiction. But they were but few of this mind, and their number became lesse, when they had heard <hi>Monsieur Hierosme</hi> the eldest of their two Ministers, now my Reverend and dear Collegue, a man of an excellent judgement, who was the <hi>Moderator</hi> in that Assembly, and who being well acquainted with the opinion the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> have of the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> (having been many years a Minister in one of them before his coming over) represented unto them that they should wrong both themselves and the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and all other Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, as well as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ask such a question, and to doubt of such a thing. Nay, he shewed them further, that such an opportunity being offered to clear the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> of that aspersion which was put upon them by some men, as if they condemned the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> it would be taken very ill by all wise men among them, if they should not wipe it off, by entring themselves freely without any more ado into the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by that fair door which was opened to them by the Royal hand of His Majesty. So that he, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other Minister and the Elders, as also the most part of the Heads of Families unanimously agreed to submit to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> thinking it a great happiness to become in every respect Members of so sound a Body, from which they never accounted themselves stangers, though they differed in some outward things in which the Essence of Religion doth not consist. It was also resolved at the same time, that a good number of the Elders with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, in the name of all should render their most humble thanks to the Kings most Excellent Majesty for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and declare that they most willingly submitted. The same were ordered likewise to go in the name of the rest of their brethren, to the right Reverend Father in God the Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to acknowledge him for their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48913:51"/> Pastor. All which was performed accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Now because no manner of force was laid upon any, it was left free for such as were not fully satisfied in their judgement, to advise thereupon with whom they pleased, either here or beyond the Seas; who therefore writ to the Consistory of the Reformed Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> as also to the Ministers and Elders of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> in <hi>Aquitain.</hi> The <hi>Quaere</hi> they put to them was this, Whether they might with a good Conscience become Members of the <hi>French Church</hi> newly erected by the Kings Majesty, wherein Divine Service was to be performed according to the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> The Consistory of <hi>Paris</hi> made no answer, partly for the same Reason for which Mr. <hi>Hierosme</hi> would not have had that <hi>Quaere</hi> put to them, in the name of the whole Congregation, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no question to be made of such a thing; all the world knowing that the French Reformed Churches ever since Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, have been very careful to entertain Communion and good correspondence with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because if such a Question were to be debated and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded anew, it would have been counted a great presumption for the Ministers of one single Church, be it never so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and be they never so many, or so learned, to take upon themselves a business of so high concernment. But that these men might be brought out of that uncertainty and doubt wherein they seemed to be, such of the Ministers as were acquainted with them, returned this answer for their satisfaction, That they ought not to <hi>make any scruple to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Order of our Church.</hi> This information I have from <hi>Monsieur Drelincourt,</hi> one of the said Ministers; who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further in his Letter, that <hi>he praiseth God,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the endeavours of the <hi>Walloons</hi> Church of <hi>London,</hi> to pull down the <hi>French Church</hi> of <hi>Westminster, She doth yet subsist by the Goodness and Liberality of the King. Monsieur Gaches</hi> another of the Ministers, having received of Mr. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosme</hi> an account of what passed in this new establishment, &amp; of the reasons for which he so freely submitted to the Church of <hi>England</hi> without taking any counsel of any beyond the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48913:51"/> Seas, he doth approve of this action of his, and saith, that he is much edified thereby; <hi>Vos sentiments de charité &amp; de paix m'edifient beaucoup,</hi> saith he, this charitable and pacifique mind of yours is much edifying to me. And he is so far from advising any to forbear going to this new established Church, because of the form of publick Worship which is used therein, different from that which was used in it before, that he would have them of the <hi>Walloons</hi> Church that keep their former way, to come sometimes and be present at our Service, and receive the Lords Supper with us, to shew that they are not contrary to our way, though they use another. <hi>Si l'on vous voyoit vivre en une estroite intelligence, que vous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistassies quelquefois au Sermon &amp; a la Communion de nos freres de Londres, &amp; qu'eux a leur tour assistassent a vos Sermons &amp; a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre Communion, cela produiroit le plus bel effet du monde.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he giveth the same counsel which he useth himself upon occasions, as I shewed before out of another Letter. But I conceive that I cannot better let the world know how the setting up of this <hi>French Church</hi> after the way of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was taken by all those of the Reformed Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> as well Ministers as others, then by inserting here the following Letter all at length in both Languages, advising all them that understand <hi>French,</hi> to read onely the Original, and not my poor Translation, through which, though true and faithful, it receiveth certainly great disadvantage. The Letter is from a person of the other Sex, the most Illustrious <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Onely I must adde this, that though I have had many experiences of her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Charity, during the time I had the honour to be Chaplain to her Highnesse's Father, my Lord <hi>Duke de la Force</hi> his Grace, yet I know that I trespasse so much against her incomparable Modesty, that I may justly feare her high displeasure for putting thus her Highness in Print. Neverthelesse I must venture it, because as she her selfe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48913:52"/> acknowledgeth, <hi>The Publick Good must ever carry it before Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interest.</hi>

                        <p>I Have received almost at the same time both your Letters, by which I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the setting up of your new French Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I heard nothing before. I was very sorry that I could not steal a moment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate you there upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday last, as I did most earnestly desire to doe; And though I have scarce any time to spare this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I think it better to scribble in haste these few lines, than to keep any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my self the joy that I have for it; yet you know that it is a joy tempered with regret, and that I take enough to heart my Fathers and my Mothers interest, to be sensibly affected with the losse that their family will sustain by being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of a Pastor so dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and so much honoured of them. But because the Publick interest must carry it before that which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and that the interest of the house of God, must go before that of our private houses, I confess my sorrow doth cease, when I consider
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48913:52"/> the advantages of this esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, and that it is not only a multiplying of the Churches of our language amongst you; but likewise an evidence, that if the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines of these two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms differ in some things, it is by reason of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our conditions and not of our perswasions; and that we all agree in this, that for things external, whereof our Lord hath left the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal to his Church, she may vary them as times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do require, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wisdom of those to whom God hath entrusted the Government thereof. And that in such things pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons have nothing to do, but to submit and subject themselves with great Docibleness and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to the order of their Superiours, and to such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes as are received and established, in the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Congregations of the countries where they live. I ever longed to see <hi>London,</hi> and to be an eye witnesse of the wonders that God hath wrought in it of late, for which we have praised his name here. But I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I do wish it more then
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48913:53"/> ever I did, now that I may say <hi>Amen</hi> in my own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to your Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and to the <hi>holy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of your <hi>excellent Liturgy,</hi> and answer in your congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to your <hi>Letany,</hi> which I do say often by my selfe in my closet, there being here no publick congregation where I may say it. I do extreamly rejoice that you take the care to have that good Book newly printed in French. I assure you that the fifty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies you promise me will not lie long by me. There is not one left of the old Edition in our Booksellers shops, and every body seeks after them. I have promised some to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral persons. I gave the last I had to <hi>Monsieur Drelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</hi> I doubt not but he will write to you, to testifie his joy of this new French Church, and of the choice your King hath made of your person to be Minister therein. There is not one of our Ministers that I have seen since I received your Letters about it, but shewed himself very well satisfied therewith; as also the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty General of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And I am persvvaded that all men that understand

                        <p>BEsides that which Judge <hi>Colladon</hi> imparted to me out of his Letters concerning the business of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> I received your last a fourth night ago, by which I was informed more at large, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, the translation of your Congregation into another place; the Kings
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48913:54"/> Orders for the <hi>Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and subjection to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London;</hi> the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Minister, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the most part of your Congregation were ready to acquiesce, there being but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few that scrupled at it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be advised thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from other parts, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from this place, as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for which we delayed a little to deliberate about it in our company, and give our answer, were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid the imputation of being inclined to prescribe Laws to those of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and also that we would gladly know if that <hi>Liturgy</hi> be the same with that of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Reign, or of K. <hi>James,</hi> yea, or of the late King; or a new one compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> of which it is reported that it hath been occasion of much clamour, and ground of fears and jealousies, through which so many were led to embroyle themselves in the late Commotions.</p>
                        <p>For if the question be only about Common-Prayer mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, which doth not at all thwart the form of Service used in <hi>France</hi> and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48913:54"/> in this place, there being an uniformity of Doctrine, you know very well that those small differences were not stuck at, and that as those of our way may communicate with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so the English Nobility and others of the same Nation, who have passed this way, have communicated with us in <hi>France</hi> and in this Church, to testifie this perfect Union. Seeing that if we should stick at such things, there is no particular Church in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> nay, nor in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> which hath not its proper Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, at which no offence is taken, there being nothing in them which savours of Idolatry or Superstition. As either we see nothing resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling (<hi>viz.</hi> Idolatry or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition) in the said English <hi>Liturgie</hi> brought in at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And since the King by the Letter, whereof a Copy hath been sent to us, enjoynes onely that the said <hi>Liturgie</hi> of <hi>Common Prayers, Gospels, Epistles, Collects,</hi> &amp;c. be used in your Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without specifying any other thing: and that which is yet most advantagious, that His Majesty is graciously

                        <p>Les raisons qui nous ont fait un peu differer a en pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre avis en nostre compagnie &amp; a y respondre ont esté principalement pour eviter qu'on ne nous mit sus de vouloir nous mesler de donner des reglements a ceux de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors &amp; aussi que nous serions bien aises de savoir si cette Liturgie est la mesme que cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le du temps de la Reine <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> ou du Roy <hi>Jaques,</hi> ou mesme du dernier Roy; Ou une nouvelle dressée par l'Arch-Evesque <hi>Laud,</hi> que l'on dit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir donné suiet a beaucoup de bruit, &amp; au suiet de laquelle tant d'Esprits ont pris om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage &amp; se sont laisses em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter aux remuements passes.</p>
                        <p>Car s'il ne s'agissoit que des prieres Communes du Matin &amp; du soir qui ne choquent point du tout la forme de Service en <hi>France</hi> &amp; ici, y ayant unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mité

There is a <hi>Father of lyes</hi> and an <hi>Accuser of our Brethren.</hi> And no doubt but they who accused the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, of not binding their Ministers to the use of their <hi>set forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi>

Thus they are told that the <hi>Convocations</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> consist only of Arch-Bishops and Bishops, and that the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Clergy is not admitted to sit and vote in them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Informers know very well, and the continued pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise ever since Reformation sheweth, that in every Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation there are <hi>two Houses,</hi> the <hi>Ʋpper</hi> and the <hi>Nether</hi> House, and that this wholly consisteth of the inferiour Clergy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reverend <hi>Deans, Prebendaries, Arch-Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> of the Clergy; and that nothing is concluded in the Upper House of Arch-Bishops and Bishops, without their advise and consent. And that it was ever so from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Reformation, unto the beginning of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of the same by the late troubles in Church and State, doth appear by the very <hi>Title</hi> of the 39. Articles, and the so much spoken against, and so much resisted <hi>Canons</hi> of the Convocation holden <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. That of the Articles
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48913:56"/> running thus, <hi>Articles agreed upon by the Arch-Bishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of both Provinces, and the whole Clergy.</hi> And that of the <hi>Canons</hi> thus; <hi>Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, treated upon by the Arch-Bishops of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and</hi> York, <hi>Presidents of the Convocations for the respective Provinces of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and</hi> York, <hi>and the rest of the Bishops and Clergie of those Provinces.</hi> They are told likewise that every one of our <hi>Bishops</hi> is a <hi>Pope,</hi> nay, more then a Pope in his Diocese, prescribing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of himself what he pleaseth to his Clergy; whereas every Bishops authority is limited by his <hi>subscription</hi> to the 39.

I could relate here many other such false reports which are made abroad of our Church-Government and Polity to defame it and make it odious to other Reformed Churches; All which I know by my own experience, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had often my ears beaten with such Tales. Wherefore hereafter wonder not, if when you are beyond the Seas, you find now and then in some men of the Reformed Religion a mis-understanding of us, but inform them aright and you are agreed.

Not that we think the conscience wounded to live under that Government. No man can be of that judgement, unless he hath lost his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or is ignorant of the rules of true Piety: But it was because they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the setting up of that new Church would be

                  <p>The following Letter is of <hi>Monsieur Rondelet</hi> a learned and eloquent Preacher, to the same Reformed Congregation of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> whither he was lately called from the Town of <hi>Barbezieux,</hi> as the custom is in <hi>France,</hi> when there are any Ministers of eminent parts in small Congregations, to translate them to others greater and more considerable.</p>

                        <p>COncerning your Church, we have been told that the answer our Consistory made lately to some private persons of that congregation, who consulted it about some scruple they made of submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the English Liturgy, hath produced some ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and that such as affect not the order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did draw the same to their advantage, as if it favoured their opinions. I know not upon what those men ground their judgment in this particular: For I do not see that they can give any sense of that Letter of our Company that is favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto them: And if it be read carefully, there will be found never a word in it that thwarts the English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, or that may occasion the least scruple of submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the same. There passed nothing, there was nothing said in our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny against the honour and authority of the Discipline
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48913:58"/> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or against the manner of her Government, to which we bear a singular reverence, the establishing whereof, that I may also give my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon, I esteem very holy and most lawful; and which is more, the fittest of all, to keep men in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and due respect, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press scandals, and to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Heresies. Thus much Sir, my good Brother, I thought my self obliged to write to you, to make in a manner our Apology, and to clear our judgement to such as might have a mind to mis-interpret the same.</p>

                     </note> I must shew yet further by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence, that the Ministers of the Reformed Churches abroad like very well our Publick Worship. And this I prove by their joyning with us in this our <hi>Anglico-Gallicane</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48913:59"/> Church, as <hi>Monsieur de l' Angle</hi> calleth it very properly.

Those who were more gently dealt with, were onely plundered, turned out of their Livings, or imprisoned.

                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48913:60"/> now Prebend of <hi>Duresme,</hi> a person whose worth is very well known, and my self among the rest were of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. We were all three one after another expelled out of the Island of <hi>Jersey</hi> our native Country. I had the honour, though unworthy of it, to go out first; and though it was well known in <hi>France,</hi> how zealous I was for my Mother Church, having received Episcopal Ordination at <hi>Paris</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the Chappel of that Honourable and truly Noble person, Sir <hi>Richard Browne,</hi> then His Majesties Resident in <hi>France</hi> (where all the exiled English went to Church) from the hands of the Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Thomas</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> then of <hi>Galloway;</hi> I had no sooner acquainted my friends with the condition I was in, but the Reformed Church of <hi>Caën</hi> invited me very kindly by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press sent to me to Saint <hi>Malo's,</hi> where I was, to come and be one of their Ministers in the absence of <hi>Monsieur Bochart,</hi> who was then going into <hi>Sweden.</hi> And not long after the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> having written to the Ministers of <hi>Paris,</hi> to send him a Minister to preach in French at his Highnesse's Court, I was by them recommended to that Prince, of whom likewise I received a very kind invitation by several Letters, which I have yet to shew. For what do I say all this? not to speak of my self, but to let the world know that a <hi>Priest,</hi> and a <hi>true Son of the Church of England,</hi> though expelled by the pretended Reformers, is counted a true <hi>Minister</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel by the Reformed Churches abroad, and by them che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and invited to exercise his Ministry in the midst of them, though judged unworthy thereof by those that would make poor silly people believe they are of the same judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the said Churches. Now the Providence of God, not permitting me to go to either of these places whither I was invited, but calling me to another, to wit, to be Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to his Grace my Lord <hi>Duke de la Force,</hi> as I have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before; and <hi>Monsieur le Couteur</hi> being invited likewise at the same time to the Reformed Church of <hi>Caën,</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Brevint</hi> soon after to another Church in <hi>Normandy</hi> (whence he was preferred to be Chaplain to the most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious and Renowned Prince of <hi>Turenne</hi>) we all three met
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48913:60"/> together at the Synod of that Province, there to have the Assemblies approbation; we exhibitted to them our Letters of Ordination, and others, shewing the cause of our banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; after which they first expressed much grief for the sad condition of our King and Church, and then desiring us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conform to their Rites and Ceremonies, and Orders of their Church, for the time we should live amongst them, (for a <hi>Non-conformist</hi> Minister is a thing unknown, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffered in those Churches) we were instituted into our several Churches, as the custom is, by the authority of the Synod, and that with so general a consent, that one onely who was a little possessed with <hi>Cromwell sme,</hi> having but said a word against us, was very sharply reprehended by the same Reverend <hi>Monsieur de l' Angle,</hi> I have already named more then once, who was one of the Moderators of that Assembly. What I have said before of Reverent Doctor <hi>Basire</hi> Prebend of <hi>Duresme</hi> and Arch-Deacon of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> sheweth how much he was made of by that great Prince <hi>George Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gokci</hi> the second, Prince of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> by whom he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Chair in the Divinity School. Now this is certainly a strong Argument to shew what opinion the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad, have of the Reformed Church of <hi>England.</hi> For doubtless if they had that opinion of her, which the Authors of the pretended <hi>Petition for Peace,</hi> would make us believe they have, they would not so earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, and so kindly and readily admit her Ministers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their Ministery among them, without any recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and repenting of their pretended superstitious ways.</p>

In the afore-quoted places I see <hi>Calvin</hi> may either not be understood at all by some, or misunderstood by them that are not pleas'd to see themselves condemned by this Authors words and authority. The words I suspect subject to an ill apprehension and interpretation contrary to <hi>Calvins</hi> meaning, are those where he saith, that the Laws and Statutes which every Church hath right to make for her self, <hi>must not bind the Consciences;</hi> and when he saith, <hi>that God is the Author of that Order</hi> in the Church, to which all and every one ought to submit and conform themselves with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere humility. The first may be mistaken thus, That <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> would not have such Laws and Statutes to be imposed, and the observation of them to be pressed by the Rulers of the Church, but that he would have them left free for every one to keep, or not to keep them as they list. The last may have this mis-interpretation, That <hi>Calvin</hi> doth hold such only for Schismaticks, as do not submit and conform to that which is immediately revealed and ordered of God in the express words of the holy Scripture. Wherefore to clear his meaning in these two particulars, it is to be observed, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Doctrine of all the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of what confession soever,<note place="margin">See the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s first Sermon <hi>Ad Clerum.</hi> Sect. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> God only hath power to bind immediately the consciences of men by his Commandments, as having the sole immediate jurisdiction over it; so that mens consciences are then said to be bound by humane <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> in the sense Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> blames, when they are thrust upon men as if they were <hi>Divine,</hi> and did bind their consciences immediately to the observation of them, not because they are commanded as good and profitable by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48913:67"/> lawful Superiors, who are thereto authorised by God himself; but as if they were <hi>immediate parts of Gods Worship,</hi> or of <hi>absolute necessity unto Salvation,</hi> which was the Tyranny and Usurpation of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> in the time of Christs conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation on earth; and is at this day, and hath been long since, that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> over mens consciences equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if not preferring her own Constitutions above the Law of God. This is the binding of conscience which <hi>Calvin,</hi> and and with him all other Protestant Writers both at home and abroad, will by no means allow to the Laws and Statutes of any Church.

                     <hi>are not fixed and perpetual, but only external Rudiments of humane infirmity;</hi> which although all of us do not need, yet we all use, <hi>being all bound mutually to maintain love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selves one towards another. This may appear in the instances above mentioned. What? is there any Religion in the Veil of a Woman, so that it should not be lawful for her to go forth with her head uncovered? Is the Decree of her being silent so sacred that it may not be violated without the highest crime? Is there any mystery in bending the Knee, or in the burying of a Corps, that may not be omitted, but one must bring himself under the greatest guilt? No: For if a Woman hath occasion to make such haste to help her neighbour, that she hath not the leisure to cover her head, she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no fault if she runs to him bare-headed. And it may be as fit for her to speak in some occasions, as in others to be silent. Nothing forbids likewise that he who cannot kneel by reason of some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, should pray standing. Lastly, it is better to bury speedily a dead Body, than to keep it till it be corrupted for want of a sheet to wrap it in, or company to go along with it to the grave. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless in the said things, there is somewhat which the custom of the Country, the Laws, and lastly, Humanity it self, and the rule of modesty, doth dictate that it ought to be done or omitted: wherein if
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48913:68"/> any thing be done amiss, imprudently, or through forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fulness, you have committed no crime: but if you have done so by contempt, it is a contumacy not to be approved of. It matters not likewise what days, what hours, what structure of places, be design'd for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or what Psalms be sung upon such a day: yet it is meet that there be certain set days and hours, and a place fit to hold all the Congregation, if any care be had of the preservation of peace. For of how great jarres and wrangling will that confusion be the seed, if it be lawful for every one to change as he pleaseth those things which pertain to all in common? Since it will never come to pass that the same thing should please all men, if all things be left at random for every one to do what he listeth. If any doth here gainsay and seem to himself to be wiser then he should, let him take heed how he will justifie his peevishness before the Lord. As for us, this saying of Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>ought to be satisfactory, that we have not the custom of being contentious, neither the Churches of God.</hi> Where it is plain, that he doth not leave it to every ones liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve or reject the publick Orders of the Church, but will have them obeyed as long as they stand in force, though with a <hi>free conscience,</hi> that is, without superstition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the opinion of an absolute and perpetual necessity of their observation, as if they constituted any essential part of Gods Worship, whereas they are but circumstances of, and helps to it. This he saith yet more fully and perspicuously in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, where he taketh away all pretence of doubting of his meaning in this point, and giveth so seasonable a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to many amongst us, that I will not save my self the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to translate it exactly; <hi>Now whereas ignorant men for the most part, when they hear that it is not without impiety that mens consciences are bound, and God worshipped in vain by humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, do blot out at one dash all Laws which constitute the Order of the Church; it is meet also to encounter here with their error. Here a man may be very easily deceived, because at first sight it doth not appear what difference there is betwixt these things,</hi> viz. Humane Traditions, &amp; Ecclesiastical Constitutions for Order and Decency's sake. <hi>But I will set forth in brief the whole matter so clearly, that their resemblance shall not be able to deceive any man. Let us before all hold this, that if in every Society of men, we see a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48913:69"/> certain Polity to be necessary,</hi>

                     <hi>for the nourishing of publick Peace, and for the maintaining of Concord; if we see that there is alwayes some Rite in force in all things that ought to be done; which Rite that it be not rejected, publick Decency, nay Humanity it self is concerned: Surely the same is chiefly to be observed in Churches, which as they are best preserved and upheld by a well-ordered consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things, so they vanish wholly and come to nought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Concord. Wherefore if we desire rightly to procure the safety of the Church, we must with all diligence take care that, as Saint</hi> Paul <hi>biddeth, all things be done decently and in good order. But whereas there is such diversity in the manners of men, such variety of minds, such contrariety of judgements and dispositions, and no Polity can stand firmly enough, unless it be constituted by certain Laws; and it is impossible that any Rite be observed without some set Form; we are so far from condemning the Laws that are made for this purpose, that we maintain, that if they be taken away, the Churches have the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now this only is alwayes to be excepted in such like Observations; that they be not thought necessary unto Salvation, and so bind the consciences by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor be intended and brought in as the worship of God, so that Piety be ascribed to them.</hi> Which Cautions, and those he

                     </note> place he ascribeth power to the Church to restrain and regulate those things which are in themselves of a middle nature, that is good or bad in the good or ill use of them. And what he saith to this purpose in general, seems to me to have so much of truth and reason, that (though he starts sometimes from himself in the particular application of the same, as I shall have occasion to observe hereafter) I think it will be of some good use, and very proper to be set down at length. For he doth not only ascribe that regulating power to the Church, and say in what it consisteth, but sheweth likewise what obligation is put thereby upon the consciences of private persons to obey the Church in such things. <hi>Those things,</hi> sayes he, <hi>which otherwise are of a middle nature, do change it in a manner, when they are either comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or prohibited by a lawful command; because that neither can they be omitted contrary to a just command, if enjoyned; nor done contrary to the prohibition, if forbidden; as it appears by the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law.</hi> And having put off the objection, that the Ceremonial Law is abolished, he adds that notwithstanding, the use of things indifferent is lawfully restrained both <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> and <hi>specially. Generally, by the Law of Charity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, by a Civil or Ecclesiastical constitution. For although God alone doth properly bind the consciences; yet in as much as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, who is the Minister of God, judgeth that it is for the publick good that those things which otherwise of themselves are lawful, be not done, or the Church for Orders-sake or Decency,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48913:70"/> and so for edification, doth rightly make Laws concerning things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; such Laws ought wholly to be observed by the Godly, and they do bind the consciences thus far, that no man knowingly and wittingly with an intention of being rebellious, may without sin either do that which is so prohibited, or leave undone those things that are so commanded.</hi> And let it be observed, that though this be counted one of <hi>Beza</hi>'s Letters, because it was penned by him, yet it is written in the name of the whole Church of <hi>Geneva, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni Fratrum ex Ʋrbe &amp; Agro Collectorum coetu;</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly of all the Ministers both of the Town and adjacent Country.

Can any one shew me upon what ground those Churches, which use to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate all such of their Members as do dispute their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in making Laws and Constitutions for their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for the outward worship of God, or do not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and conform to them when they are made; may be said with any probability to condemn the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for asserting as much power to her self, and no more, and for exercising the same? And shall we have so little value of the judgement of the Reformed Churches, as to think they will give more Authority to <hi>Thirty</hi> Ministers for they are no more in number for the most in the <hi>National Synods</hi> of <hi>France</hi>) or <hi>Fourty,</hi> for they do not exceed that number in them of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as appears by the names of the <hi>Delegates</hi> to the Synod of <hi>Dort;</hi> or to abour <hi>Five and Twenty,</hi> (for they are hardly so many at <hi>Geneva;</hi>) or to <hi>Fifteen</hi> or <hi>Sixteen</hi> and less, as in some <hi>Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Switzers;</hi> then they will think fit to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a <hi>Council,</hi> consisting (as our Convocations do) of above <hi>Six score</hi> Reverend, Grave, and Learned Divines, chosen out of <hi>many Thousands;</hi> whereof <hi>Six and Twenty</hi> are <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops;</hi> a greater number <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Prebends,</hi> and <hi>Arch-Deacons.</hi>

                     </note>30. As for the <hi>French Reformed Churches</hi> enough hath been said already to convince the World, that they are no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and those who have lived amongst them, know that they are so far from condemning that Church-Government as evil and unlawful, that they rather wish they were in a condition to enjoy the benefit thereof, most of them not sticking to say plainly, as was before observed, That if all the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> should embrace the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Doctrine, they must of necessity have Bishops, and they would most freely submit to them. Wherefore I do think it not improbably said by some (and amongst them by that learned and most worthy adopted Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Doctor <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> Prebend of Christs Church, <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and one of His Majesties Chaplains, in that Ingenious and Loyal Book of his which he set forth in <hi>French</hi> soon after the Martyrdom of the late King, for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48913:72"/> the defence of the Right both of King and Church) that God having permitted the Work of Reformation to be carried on only by the inferiour Clergy of that Kingdom, they thought it meet to keep themselves within the bounds of the Order of Priesthood; that if ever it were God Almighties will that the Bishops themselves should reform and embrace the true Doctrine, there might be no contestation with them for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction and Preeminence, but all manner of readiness on the Reformed Ministers part, to submit to the Bishops, and acknowledge them for their lawful Superiours and Prelates. For certainly it is an injury done to the Reformers of these Churches to think that they have Reformed both Church-Government, and every circumstance of outward Worship, in the same manner we see them established and used among them by choice, and because they judged them after mature deliberation to be simply the best, and of an absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. As for me I nothing doubt, but those things were so ordered by them, according to the exigency of the times, because their condition did not permit them to do otherwise. I will instance only in two particulars, among many others, which might be brought to prove the same. The Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> and others have preserved <hi>Churches</hi> in their Reformation, and have been careful to keep them <hi>cleanly,</hi> and to have them decently <hi>adorned,</hi> for the more edifying performance of Gods solemn Service. Their <hi>Clergy-men</hi> likewise have always used <hi>decent apparel</hi> different from that of <hi>Lay-men.</hi> Neither of which things was to be expected in the Reformation of the <hi>French</hi> Churches. For alas, how could those poor Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that embraced the Reformed Doctrine at first, have had stately and decently adorned Buildings for Gods Worship, that durst not assemble publickly in any place, for fear of hanging and burning: but met sometimes in Cellars, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Barns, sometimes in the open Fields? Or how could their Ministers have used decent Vestments, and appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel differing from that of other men, who for their life durst not have appeared for what they were? And therefore were forced to wear coloured, and Tradesmens, and sometimes Souldiers clothes, to preserve themselves under that disguise.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48913:73"/> The same judgement is to be made of other things of the like nature. And that it was the hardness and calamity of the times that constrained them so to do, and that they were not led thereto by their own choice, appears by their erecting of fair Churches as soon as they had that Liberty in every place according to their ability,<note place="margin">See the Acts of the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> as may be seen at <hi>Charenton, Roan, Caen, Saumur, Mont Alban,</hi> and elsewhere; and by the exhortations of their National Synods, renewed in that which was held last at <hi>Loudun,</hi> to set apart every where (where conveniently they may) some publick place fit for Gods service. The like appears also by their Ministers now leaving their ordinary apparel when they perform Church-duties; and by their constant using of Gowns and Cassocks (as hath been observed before) where they may freely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for what they are. Now that this may not seem an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion from that subject I have in hand, I say, the same judgement must be made touching the equality of Ministers they introduced &amp; maintained within themselves til this day. They could do no otherwise; though the Reason hinted at by Dr. <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> had not diverted them from attempting it. For who seeth not that the Popish Bishops would never have suffered any Minister to take their Titles, for example, those of <hi>Paris, Roan, Lyons, Orleans, Bordeaux,</hi> and the like. But that they did not introduce their equality out of an opinion of the unlawfulness of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> is most clearly made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by their readiness to submit to those Bishops, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their former errors, should profess the truth of the Gospel. Of this there is a famous example which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a little after the <hi>Colloquie</hi> or <hi>Conference</hi> of <hi>Poissi, Joannes, Antonius,</hi> of the Illustrious Family of the <hi>Coracioli,</hi> Son of the most renowned Prince of <hi>Melfi,</hi> and a man of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, being Bishop of <hi>Troyes</hi> in the Province of <hi>Champagne,</hi> was convinced of the truth of the Doctrine professed in the Reformed Churches. But being desirous that his conversion might profit the people of his Diocese that were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his charge; which he thought would hardly be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less such as had already embraced the Reformed Religion, did submit to his Government, and acknowledge him for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48913:73"/> their Bishop and Pastor; he made his address unto them for that purpose, and was by them acknowledged, they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submitting to his Government. Which submission of theirs was generally approved by all their Brethren, and likewise by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi>

                        <p>WE acknowledge that this Order hath signal advantages; And I think not that any of my brethren will contradict me, if I say that wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Episcopacy hath most important and considerable u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities which cannot be found in the Presbyterian Discipline. If we have followed the last in our Churches, it is not for any aversion that we have against the former: It is not because we hold Episcopacy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, or because we think it less convenient for the good of the Church, or less worthy of the condition of the true flocks of the Lord; but it is because <hi>necessity</hi> hath obliged us to it; because Reformation having been begun in this Kingdom by the people and by inferiour Church-men, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Bishops remain'd filled with men of a contrary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, so that we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to content our selves with Ministers and Elders as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48913:74"/> well as we could, for fear of setting Bishop against Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in the same Town, which would have caused furious troubles and implacable wars, and put a great stop to the progress of the Gospel. If Bishops had embraced the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation at the first, I make no doubt but that their order had been maintained in the Ecclesiastical Polity. And I find a convincing proof of that in an Epistle of <hi>Martyr;</hi> it is the 57. inscribed to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus Beza,</hi> where he speaks to him of the Bishop of <hi>Troyes</hi> in <hi>Champagne,</hi> where God had gathered a great and numerous Church. He saith that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of that Town having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Truth, begun to preach it publickly, and (being a man of great parts) advanced the Kingdom of Christ mightily; but that a great scruple being come into his mind about his calling, he assembled the Elders of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, to know of them whether they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and he desired them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely to deliberate of it among themselves. Which when they had done with all the prudence and wisdom requisite, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto him unanimously,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48913:75"/> that they acknowledged and received him for their true and lawful Bishop. Can any doubt but that if the other Bishops of the Kingdom had followed his example, and given glory to God as he did, they had continued in their station, and preserved their dignity? For <hi>Martyr</hi> in that Epistle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth both the Bishops acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the resolution of the Elders. He writes of this to <hi>Beza,</hi> as of a thing for which he praiseth God, and for which he knew that <hi>Beza,</hi> that great Servant of God, would rejoyce with him. Wherefore the practise of the Churches of <hi>France</hi> ought to be no president for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For in the Church of <hi>England</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation having been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the Bishops, there would be reason to think it strange, if Episcopacy had not been preserved therein. And if there be any in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this time that be so rigidly partial for Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an parity, as to justle against that ancient order of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and seek to root it quite out to the prejudice both of <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>State,</hi> they cannot but be very much blamed for it.</p>

                           <p>THe name of <hi>BISHOP</hi> cannot be strange to any man that is acquainted with Scripture, since it is found in Scripture.

De mesme dans l'Eglise un gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement ordinaire ne pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roit pas la contenir: Elle s'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteroit au dela des bornes si l'authorité Episcopale qui est la plus souveraine que l'Eglise peut recognoistre, n'estoit establie pour y don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ordre, &amp; pour pourvoir a ses dereglements. En effect

Et qu'un Synode composé d'eganx, &amp; d'Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, &amp; de Diacres qui bien souvent ne s'y connoissent pas ne peuvent pas arrester, parce que les Autheurs du mal se croyent aussi grands Seigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urs que ceux qui eclattent le plus, &amp; meprisent une bonne partie de ceux qu'on employe ordinairement pour y apporter du remede? Qui ne sçait que dans les pais bas toutes les Academies ont quelques cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses a demester ensemble que l'authorité des Evesques au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roit deja bien termin és, &amp; qui eclatteroient encore bien d'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage si l'authorité seculiere n'empeschoit le mal de gagner plus avant. Nos Adversai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res en cela sont ils pas extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mement heureux? Car sans leur gouvernement Episcopal ils seroyent dechirez en mille factions &amp; ce grand corps de l'Eglise Romaine se trouve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roit bien tost demembré. Mais

                        <p>Je ne sçaurois oublier icy qu'il faudroit manquer bien de Prudence &amp; de Charité pour presser avec emportement la ruine des Evesques.

                        <p>Pour moy je loûe Dieu de nostre Reformation en <hi>France.</hi> Mais je ne crain point de dire que si nous avions conservé des Evesques &amp; autant de Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies qu'il en faut pour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacher le peuple &amp; n'estre pas superstitieux, on auroit assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rement vù la Reformation gagner beaucoup plus loin &amp; venir a bout de la resistance d'une infinité de personnes que l'irregularité de nostre Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement &amp; la simplicité de nostre service effarouche de nostre Communion.</p>
                        <p>Mais quand nous n'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions pas dessein d'attirer Messieurs de <hi>Rome,</hi> que di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ront ceux de la Confession <hi>d'Ausbourg</hi> que nous tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chons par toutes sortes de bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner voyes d'engager dans no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre parti.

                        <p>HOw great was your joy to see the Kings entry into <hi>London!</hi> And how lowd did you shout <hi>Io triumphe!</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that in all your life you have seen a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious day. Sure you desire no more to see one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Triumphs. Or if ever you were tempted with that desire, as that Father of the Church was once, you are now weaned from it, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wish as he did, to hear the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Truly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48913:76"/> could that great man who was once from the Earth rapt into the third Heaven come down again at present upon earth, to tell us how the Church of God ought to be ordered, and how the differences about Church-Government might be happily composed; it would be a happy advantage for the Anglican Church in her present condition.</p>
                        <p>Truly I believe not that it is possible to keep either peace or order in your Church, without preserving the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Dignity. And I confesse that I conceive not by what spirit they are led that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that Government, and cry it down with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. For I defie any man whosoever he be to shew me if he can an other Order more suitable with reason, yea, or better agreeing with holy Scripture, and of which God hath made more use for the establishment of his Truth, and the amplification of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>I say it is suitable with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; for who can deny that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48913:77"/> reason requires that in all sorts of things there be some order and superiority; and that equality very often is the mother of Confusion? Of that we have but too many experiences. For that reason under the Old Testament God would have his people to be ruled by Priests who were above the Levites, and by Chief Priests, and High Priests. Which certainly he would not have done, had he judged a down-right equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the most reasonable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World. And as for the Church in the Apostles time, was it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conducted by a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment far different from the equality of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians? Indeed Pastours were established in severall Churches, yet those Pastors yielded obedience unto the Apostles, looking upon them still as placed in a higher degree. Which sheweth that Subordination and Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are not incompatible with the Government of the Church. Neither did that Dignity of Apostle onely give Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But also I make no doubt but that they that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their calling immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Apostles had
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48913:77"/> Superiority above those that had not the same advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                        <p>For example, I make no doubt but that <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> who had that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, were more honoured for it of the people, yea, and were made more venerable thereby to their fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. For as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate calling of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists and Apostles by our Lord Jesus Christ did raise them above others; So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the calling conferred by the hands of the Holy Apostles made them upon whom they conferred it more considerable in the Church of God; This impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands being far more honourable then that which was conferred by meer and common Pastours, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily more accompanied with the effusion of the Holy Ghost. Which also was one of the things that gave Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in the Primitive Church. For it is certaine that in that Church God made a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full distribution of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yea, that he spake very lowd by the miracles of his servants to draw many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48913:78"/> to his holy knowledge. Now who can doubt but that such as possest a great measure of the Spirit of the Lord, and shined with more miracles were above others? And that the Churches would chuse them to be their leaders, and yield honour unto them, as to those whom God had chosen for the chief objects of his liberalities, and his chief instruments for the establishment of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                        <p>And this, Sir, lasted all the time of the first age, during almost all which time the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Saint <hi>John</hi> was still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, who certainly did mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate all the Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi> Which sheweth that in the first age there was always some Subordination in the Church, and that in the time of her innocency she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conducted by a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equivalent to the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal. And after she had no more Apostles nor persons that had received their esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment from those holy persons, and that the gift of prophecy and miracles was a little abated, the Church look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her own conduct, and making use of her own ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to fill the vacant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of those whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48913:78"/> had immediately rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the midst of Gods Churches, did presently chuse Bishops: And seeing that God did then hardly put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inequality between her Pastours, by the difference of his miraculous gifts, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to put some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them by the plurality of her Votes; God having not taken from her the liberty of so doing, but rather given her reason, by examples, to hope that it would be an useful practise, and not displeasing unto him. In effect in the second age the Church chose Bishops for her selfe, and beginning just at the time when the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God left her to her own conduct, and when she found her selfe in case to go alone, she chose Superiours, and such as might be above the ordinary degree of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, as God himselfe in the first age had instituted such an order, and would have his Church ruled in that golden time by an Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government. Neither did God shew that he disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that his Church should so do, and conform her selfe to the patterne which God shewed her upon <hi>Zion,</hi> whence
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48913:79"/> the Doctrine is derived to us. Rather he hath blessed that design and made it prosper in the most miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the World. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any work more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, or cast down more Monsters then the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Prelates. If then God hath so blessed them, are not those men besides themselves in an horrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that undertake to curse them? If the ancient Church did set them forth as her glory, have they any reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them as the shame and dishonour of <hi>Israel?</hi> If that Government hath made the glory of Christ to triumph, is it sufferable that any should maintain them to be the pillar and ground of untruth, and the <hi>Basis</hi> upon which alone the tyranny of Antichrist is setled? Certainly to make such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is a very rash part; and in my opinion it goes beyond all examples of ingratitude, so to reward the obligation we have to so many Bishops of great note, who with so many Illustrious Examples of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and fidelity in Gods Service, have delivered down his Truth unto us, repurged from those errors wherewith a swarm of Hereticks had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48913:79"/> to poison it. But if ever any in this particular made their ungratefulness notorious, certainly they are the English opposers of Episcopacy, who will not consider that they owe their Reformation to the care and zeale of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops who did so wonderfully well repurge the Church of <hi>England</hi> a hundred years ago, and so happily set up the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Truth againe in its genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine lustre. But this is not all they owe unto them: they owe them also their whole Christianity. For whether it was brought over into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> or by <hi>Simon Canneus,</hi> or by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or by Saint <hi>Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Why then should any be passionate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Government? And what want of Braines is it to believe that they can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage themselves by shaking off a Government which hath continued in their Church for so many ages? Can any man
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48913:80"/> resolve upon such extremities but a lover of confusion, and a man that hath little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and one that knows not that changes are of dangerous consequence?</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, (to omit that it cannot enter into a rational mans imagination, that a great Kingdome should come by custom to be content to see its Bishops no more, having honoured and reverenced them for the space of 1400. years;) what shall be done with all the Church Revenues? To what use shall they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied? Must so many things which Devotion hath brought together be torne in pieces and dismembred? And might not this question trouble the Kingdom once more, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those Lands and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues which were appointed onely for pious uses, may lawfully be possest by secular persons? So much I know, that it is a point which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubleth the City of <hi>Ʋtrecht,</hi> and may there bring forth strange revolutions. Is it not then more reasonable to leave things as they are, and not to hinder deserving persons from possessing those advantages without which their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48913:80"/> merit would seldome rise high enough, nor would they find themselves in condition to exercise all the vertues which the Apostle requireth in a Bishop? Besides, Sir, ought we not to learne wisdome by our experience? I pray what good have these troublers of <hi>Israel,</hi> that are so contrary to Bishops, done for well nigh these twenty yeares that they have ruled? How far have they advanced their Work? Hath the Church enjoyed more rest by their <hi>Anarchy?</hi> Nay, on the contrary, have not all things grown still worse and worse? Have not Heresies grown bold, and lift up their head? And did ever Satan work more mischiefe then he did since the time that these men became ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? This indeed in point of Conscience ought to make them tremble with horrour, and after such a visible curse upon all their enterprises they should now at once give them over. They ought to give glory unto God, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that certainly their work is not the worke of God, and that it is a farre wiser course for them to let those Rule whose Government is famous by a thousand blessings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48913:81"/> God hath often crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, I must here adde this consideration, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that any Nation in the World hath more need of Bishops then the English. For they have a natural fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and withall a natural inclination to superstition. Both which are apt to set them upon great enterprises, and to cast them upon strange extremities, unless they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by some power some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what despoticall. And as there is no Nation less fit to be governed by a popular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, because all the English have too much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for that, are too unquiet and jealous, and all think themselves born to Reigne; all which things, as you know, have need of an extreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be kept in. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the Church an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Government could not keep it in order, but it would go beyond all bounds, were not Episcopal Authority (which is the most Soveraign that the Church can submit to) established to take care of it and to prevent disorders. In effect, Sir, there is no other power but the Episcopal can remedy an infinity of evils,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48913:81"/> that may arise in the Church. For I beseech you let us not flatter our selves, in <hi>France</hi> where we have a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Government, are we not subject unto many divisions, which the equality of Pastors is not able to compose? And which a Synod consisting of equal persons, and of Elders and Deacons) who many times have little skill in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Government) is not able to stop, because the Authors of the evil hold themselves to be of equal power with those that are of prime note, and despise most of them that are ordinarily imployed to heale those distempers? Who knows not that in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> all the Universities have some differences which the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Bishops might have ended long ago, and which would break out with more violence, did not the secular Authority keep the evil from growing further? Are not our Adversaries very happy in that point? For were it not for their Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they would be torn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a thousand Factions; and that great body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would in a short time be dismembred. But having Superiours, who watch over
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48913:82"/> a whole Diocese, or over a whole Province, the evil is speedily prevented, and the Factious are constrained to yield. They have alwayes some deference and some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for the Superiours, and the Union being howsoever alwayes preserved, the evil is not so scandalous and of such dangerous consequence. It is that which upholds the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Churches. For in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Norway, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> they are very quiet under the Episcopal Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and seldom are they seen to slander and tear one another. Whereas other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments have much adoe to avoid that. Why then should we be so unreasonable as to refuse to make profit of that, and apply to our selves that which we see practised with such advantagious success in the eyes of all the World?</p>
                        <p>I must not forget to say, that it is meerly out of want of Prudence and Charity if any seek the ruine of Bishops with a violent zeale. For who knows not that this is one of the things which makes the Romanist most averse from the Communion of our
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48913:82"/> Churches, even the nakedness of our Government? And that when they see that we have no conformity with the whole ancient Church in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Discipline, they cannot perswade themselves that we are in the right way, our way appearing to them so remote from that of the Primitive Church?</p>
                        <p>For my part, I praise God for our Reformation in <hi>France.</hi> But I fear not to say, that if we had kept Bishops, and as many Ceremonies as would serve to fix the attention of the people without supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we should have seen for certaine, farre greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses of Reformation, and the resistance of a great many persons overcome who are frighted from our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the irregularity of our Government, and the bareness of our Service.</p>
                        <p>But though our end were not to win the Romanists, what will those of the Confession of <hi>Auspurg</hi> say, whom we endeavour by all good wayes to engage in our party? Would not Reconcilers have great reason to dispair of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their enterprise, if when we present unto them the hand of fellowship, we draw it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48913:83"/> back presently, and go farre from them by the ruine of the Episcopal Government? Truly that onely Circumstance ought to appease your English dissenters, and bring them, if they have any Charity, to consent to the re-establishment of that Government, though there were something in it which they could not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether approve of. But I am a little afraid that such is their disposition, that they take lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care for ought we see of others, and are ready to say to God, <hi>Hast thou made us our Brethrens keepers,</hi> that we should engage our selves so farre for them, and trouble our selves so much about them? But their inclination will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so many godly English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens practise to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And I trust that the King whom God hath so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously preserved and settled again upon his Throne, will be sure to re-establish the Authority of the <hi>Anglican</hi> Church, and after he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored unto the Church her former Dignity, use his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a perfect re-union of all the Reformed Churches. Which that he may effect, His Majesty must preserve his Bishops. And though he had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48913:83"/> none in his Kingdom, his own Wisdom would suggest unto him, that it were necessary to set up some.</p>

                  <p>You see that the best Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could not speak better in behalf of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> And let it not be objected that it is but one single Ministers private judgment; for though perhaps they do not all express themselves thus far because they have not all applied themselves so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the consideration of Church-Government, as this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ingenious man hath; yet they all agree with him in this, that Episcopacy is lawful, and the fittest of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And they all complain of those that give out, that they oppose and blame it as evil, taking that report for a great injury done to them.

I will praise the Lord as long as I live, because he that is mighty hath done for us great things. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and his servant whom he had brought low, he hath lift up on high,</hi> and hath made it manifest unto all, that there is a God in Heaven that judgeth the transactions and the doings of men, who disposeth of them according to his pleasure, and when they grow licentious, and break out of the path of righteousness and humanity, he keeps them within the channel of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and duty. But especially he taketh in hand the cause of his <hi>Anointed,</hi> when it seemed unto all to be most abandoned, and so desperate, that it seemed incapable of any remedy, unless it were ministred by God himself; adorning the Royal Head of your King with so many Rayes of Grace, and giving him such an amiable Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the alienation of his subjects from him, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath raised so many storms, is now turned into love. From that horrible ruine which had miserably defaced him, he now riseth glorious and lovely; and that Furnace of afflictions into which God whose wayes are unsearchable, had cast him, makes him appear a <hi>Son of God, and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light.</hi> The affections of his people have not past in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but have equalled the swiftness of our Prayers, and the torrent of blessings wherewith God overfloweth his Royal Throne is risen far above his very hopes. Come then, Dear Sir, let us say of his most excellent Majesty that which the Psalmist saith of his King, <hi>His glory is great in thy salvation, O Lord, Honour and Majesty hast thou laid upon him.</hi> We trust that his piety and gratefulness towards God will enable us to apply to him likewise the words that follow a little after, <hi>For the King trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

                           <p>Now, Sir, I make no question but that your King to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48913:84"/> the affairs of his Church and Kingdom, will take a clean contrary course to that of the Tyrant who hath for so many years usurped and defiled his Throne; For the Prudence of <hi>Cromwell</hi> which was all earthly and devilish, took care of nothing else but his profit, and the setling of his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fortune, without any regard of the Kingdom of Christ trodden under in <hi>England.</hi> Neither did he ever repress the impiety of ungracious men, who had as many Gods as Houses; which indeed was a great shame to our Religion. But the Kings most Excellent Majesty following the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and embracing holy Counsels, will begin at Gods house before he think of his own, and will seek before all things the Kingdom of God, and the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof. My heart did leap for joy when I was told that your Liturgy and ancient Discipline should be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again, and that already it did appear like a joyful mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the rising of the King your Sun, promising a faire and bright day. I cannot but have good hope of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, by the use whereof the Church of <hi>England</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with so many blessings for so many years. And I cannot tell what those <hi>Haters of the peace of the Church</hi> mean that prattle up and down, and talk as if the <hi>French Churches</hi> were great adversaries to the Episcopal Order; and as if we held it quite contrary unto <hi>Christs Kingdom,</hi> and affirmed it to be a foul Relick of Antichristianisme. God forbid, Sir, that we should have such a perverse and rash opinion. I am sure that neither <hi>Monsieur Daillé,</hi> nor <hi>Monsieur Amiraut,</hi> nor <hi>Monsieur Bochart,</hi> nor any of my Collegues of <hi>Rouen</hi> ever approved of it; I that am the least of my Brethren am as far from it as any. Truly an Episcopacy distracted and carried about within and without the Walls of our <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to several abuses; An <hi>Episcopacy</hi> altogether independent and lawless, making of a mans will his Law, doing all the functions of such an important Ministery with its particular and dispotical pleasure, is an unlucky and horrible thing in the House of God, drawing near to Antichristianity if it be not rather a part of it. But an Episcopacy well tempered and well poised, an Episcopacy
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48913:85"/> framed after the model which was exercised with so much success by those <hi>Prelates</hi> of the Apostolick Churches which Christ calls <hi>Angels,</hi> such as <hi>Clemens, Polycarpus, Iraeneus, Cyprianus, Athanasius, Chrysostom,</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the like kind, who have been in the Church the sweet savour of Christ: it is a most sacred and most ancient Order, and if the Apostles themselves were not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it, certainly it was instituted by Apostolick men, who might say of their Ordinances of this nature, the same that the Apostle said sometimes after he had gravely resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved some questions, about which he had no express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, <hi>I think also that I have the spirit of God.</hi>

                  <p>The following Extract out of a Letter which <hi>Monsieur Gayon</hi> one of the Ministers of the Reformed Church of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> directed to my self not long after my coming over into <hi>England</hi> the last year, may very well be produced in this place to prove the same thing with the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Ministers of the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> are no enemies to <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> And that the Presbyterians may not think themselves wronged in the discription by me made of them, unto which his Letter doth relate, I do here protest that what I said of them came only to this; 1. That they had no <hi>set Forms,</hi> nor indeed would admit of any, whether for <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> or for <hi>Administration of Sacraments, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, &amp;c.</hi> 2. That for a long time many of them had left off using that very <hi>Form</hi> our Lord hath taught us. 3. That most of them had likewise wholly neglected the use of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> for many years. 4. That there was a great ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence at <hi>Prayer</hi> in their Congregations, very few <hi>kneeling,</hi> and many not so much as <hi>pulling off their Hats;</hi> but either not <hi>uncovering their Heads</hi> at all. or only a little their <hi>Pole,</hi> as if they were playing at <hi>Boe peep,</hi> or laying their <hi>Hat</hi> on one <hi>Ear</hi> like <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Fanfaroons,</hi> as I have observed already. Of this irreverente I am an eye-witness my self, as also of their <hi>omitting</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> in their publick exercises. But I need no proofs for those things that are known to all the three Kingdoms as these are, and likewise their <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48913:85"/> suffer. And as for the rejecting of all <hi>set Forms</hi> of Prayer, and for the Administration of Sacraments, &amp;c. I have these grounds; First, their abolishing the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> which they had engaged themselves to observe; and next their setting up no other in the place, but only a <hi>Directory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> whence the very <hi>Creeds,</hi> as well that of the <hi>Apostles</hi> as those of <hi>Nice</hi> and of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> were expunged, and the Lords Prayer only <hi>recommended,</hi> but not <hi>commanded</hi> to be said. For if they had been displeased only with some things in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> why did they abolish it wholly? Or if indeed that <hi>Liturgy</hi> was by them disliked, and not all <hi>Liturgies</hi> whatsoever; why did they not take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof one of them that are used in other Reformed Churches, according to the pattern of which they engaged to reform this Church in their <hi>Solemn League and Covenant.</hi> They might have taken the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Belgick Churches,</hi> or of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or that of the <hi>Reformed Churches of France,</hi> and of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which was made by <hi>Calvin:</hi> Or if they were not well pleased with any of them all, why did they not make a new one, which had been as easily done as their <hi>Directory?</hi> I might adde for confirmation of the opinion I have of them touching <hi>set Forms,</hi> their <hi>new Directory,</hi> for so I call that which they lately published under the name of a <hi>Liturgy;</hi> There being only this difference betwixt the first <hi>Directory</hi> and this last, that in the first the things to be prayed for were set down <hi>obliquely,</hi> whereas in the last the Prayers are <hi>direct.</hi> But however it is still but a <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,</hi> since it is left to the Ministers liberty to pray <hi>thus</hi> or to <hi>that effect</hi> as he listeth; that is to say, not to pray thus at all. And therein doth lie the <hi>fallacy,</hi> which is easily discovered by any man of understanding. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think I do them no wrong, when giving a <hi>Character</hi> of them, I say among other things, that they are enemies of all manner of <hi>set Forms</hi> to be alwayes used. But this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the occasion offered; it is time to produce the above-mentioned Extract of Reverend <hi>Monsieur Gayon</hi>'s Letter.</p>

                     <hi>There are some other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> saith he, <hi>in which the Pastors have not only a different Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but also differ in the very Order it self, as they who enjoy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. For it is certain that many ages since they have vindicated to themselves, not only to have some authority, but also to constitute an Order by themselves, and thereby to have their preeminence, and so to enjoy a peculiar Dignity according to their Order. Wherefore since Christ and his Apostles have expresly ordained this clearly, That all particular Churches be governed by their Pastors, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by some form of Government, which is the dictate of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity it self; And that the nature of the thing it self doth not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which chiefly must be the form of Government; neither have Christ and his Apostles constituted that so clearly; The first ground of Concord that seemeth necessary to be laid, is this, That the Pastors of the Reformed Churches henceforth continue the same that they have been formerly, and that the Reformed Churches do not take upon them to shake and overthrow the State of each other.</hi> Where
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48913:88"/> it is manifest that he is no enemy to <hi>Eiscopacy;</hi> since he would have it retained in those Reformed Churches where it is, and where it hath the greatest authority, and is the most highly dignified. And though to his judgement he do not find so clearly set down in Scripture by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>what</hi> must be the <hi>form</hi> of Church-Government, as that there must be a <hi>Government</hi> in the Church; yet he dares not say, but that <hi>Hierarchical Subordination</hi> as well as any other may pretend to that advantage: wherefore he is so far from condemning it as evil and unlawful, as that he would not have by any means those Churches that enjoy it, to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon that account. As for the famous <hi>Peter du Moulin,</hi> he hath declared himselfe an approver and a lover of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government</hi> in sundry places of his Writings.

                     <hi>the Bishop and Clergy being departed thence, to have chosen in his room any
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48913:89"/> other Bishop, had been a thing altogether impossible.</hi> However, it doth not at all appear that <hi>Farellus, Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> who are the true Reformers of the <hi>Geneva Church,</hi> introduced <hi>Equality</hi> in the <hi>Ministry</hi> out of any dislike of <hi>Hierarchical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination.</hi> The truth is, that both at <hi>Geneva</hi> and other places, where the Magistrates and Bishops together did not Reform, but onely private persons and the inferiour Clergy, they were wholly bent to the bringing in of true Doctrine, and little thought of Church-Government. So that when they had perfected that part of Reformation which they chiefly intended as their main work, the Priests and Preachers that had been employed in it, finding themselves equal one to the other, they continued as they were. And thus, I conceive, came <hi>Presbytery</hi> into the World, both at <hi>Geneva</hi> and other places, to wit, either by <hi>meer chance,</hi> or out of <hi>necessity;</hi> not by <hi>choice,</hi> nor by a <hi>rebellious opposition</hi> to <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> whereof there never were any Christians guilty, that I know, besides our <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Presbyterians. True it is, that since where the Presbyterian Discipline was established, many able men that lived under it, have brought what they could in behalf thereof. But their Reasons were but <hi>Argumenta ex post facto,</hi> Reasons shewing, as they conceived, the <hi>lawfulness</hi> and <hi>conveniency</hi> of what was done amongst them; not Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced to demonstrate that there was any <hi>necessity</hi> of so doing in other Churches and Countries. The which may be said of the <hi>Reformed Genevans</hi> as well as of any others, as I shall undoubtedly make it appear out of the Writings of their chiefest Authors; when I have here reported what they say to vindicate themselves from the imputation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forced their Bishop out of their City and Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is said that he was the Temporal Lord as well as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Governour.</p>

                     <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1537. the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> after a very long war, seeing that he could not prevaile against the City, sent an Embassador to the <hi>Genevans,</hi> promising them great matters if they would forsake the Reformed Religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Images, turn out the Ministers, and receive againe their Bishop; to whom they returned this answer, That <hi>for their Bishop he should be welcome, so that he would remember his name and place, and do the work of a Bishop according to the word of God;</hi> but as for the rest, they were to obey God rather then men, and that as long as <hi>Geneva</hi> should remember that she was free and consecrated to God alone, it must not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they would set up again any thing tending to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition. Now if these things be so, I may say most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, that when <hi>Geneva</hi> Reformed Religion, she did not think it a part of Reformation to abolish Episcopacy, and that if it had pleased God that the then Bishop of that Church and City had embraced the Reformed Doctrine, there had been preserved a succession of Bishops, as here in <hi>England</hi> and other Reformed Kingdoms. So that the fault was not in the <hi>Genevans,</hi> but in their Bishop. Nevertheless I confess that were it not for Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who sayes it was impossible to set up another Bishop in his room, I could hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48913:93"/> to them for omitting of so necessary a duty. But is enough for my purpose, to shew that they were well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that if their Bishop had professed the Reformed Religion, they would not have dealt with him as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Bishops have been dealt withall among us in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the pretenders to conformity of opinions with <hi>Geneva,</hi> though they are very far from it, and they do the <hi>Genevans</hi> much wrong in saying they are of the same mind with them as to these matters.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. But, it will be said, perhaps, that <hi>Geneva</hi> hath been since of another perswasion, after <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> were among them, and taught them otherwise then they were by their first Reformers. For it is to be observed, that neither <hi>Calvin</hi> nor <hi>Beza</hi> were at <hi>Geneva</hi> during all this time. Wherefore let us enquire into the truth of this, and let us see first whether <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> whom I will produce here speaking, as well for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> as for his own self, will be found as right for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as I promised he would, when I pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my word for him as to this point.</p>

                     </note> Here again I must confess that for a time hearing some men among us speak of <hi>Calvin,</hi> as if he were entirely theirs and as if he consented altogether with them about Church-Government; I was in the same error with those that take him to be the great <hi>Champion</hi> of Presbyterian <hi>parity</hi> against Hierarchical <hi>Subordination.</hi> But having perused most of his Works, specially it where those is most likely that he should treat of this point, I have been otherwise perswaded, not finding any where the least word against the Office of a Bishop. And for all that I have either read of, or in him, or seen produced out of his Writings, I am of this mind, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was the Government that he approved most, and that he took it to be, as it is undoubtedly, of Apostolical Institution; though his opinion was, That the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her exigencies, in relation to places, times, and other circumstances, may dispence with it. This pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of his in that Epistle he writ to Cardinal <hi>Sadolet,</hi> I conceive to be to that purpose. <hi>We deny not that we want a Discipline, such as the Ancient Church had. But can they in justice accuse us to have overthrown the Discipline of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48913:94"/> the Church,</hi>

But as for Doctrine we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be tried by the ancient Church.</hi> In these words he grants that the Presbyterian Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is new, which the lovers of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us deny. And that whereas he and his Collegues were willing to restore the same Discipline that was in use in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church (which can be no other then the <hi>Episcopal,</hi> if the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> be not it) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by her opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and persecutions had put an obstacle to that good work.<note place="margin">Veteri amico nunc Praesuli.</note>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> writes another Epistile which is to be found in the volume of his <hi>Opuscula to an old Friend of his who was become a Bishop</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In which Epistle, though it is very prolix, he doth not speak one word against the Office of a Bishop, but only against the sundry abuses thereof in the Romish Church. Nay he is so far from blaming it, that it appears, he did rather hold it not only lawful, but (as I said even now) of Apostolical and Divine Institution.

As long as the substance of Doctrine is uniform in the Church of Christ, we may lawfully vary in other matters, as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of time, place and persons requireth, and as prescription of Antiquity may warrant.

In the first <hi>Edition</hi> were inserted the 39. <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as having <hi>publick Authority.</hi> In this later <hi>Edition,</hi> there were some factious men, who moved upon the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> account to have the 39. <hi>Articles</hi> left out, and the <hi>new Confession</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> put in stead thereof; which if it had been effected, I confess the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> might truly say that <hi>Geneva</hi> had declared for them against the <hi>Church of England.</hi> But the motion having been wholly rejected, and the 39. <hi>Articles</hi> (whereof the thirty sixth contains our <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical Subordination</hi>) Reprinted in their same place as formerly, together with Bishop <hi>Jewels</hi> Apology for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without so much as mentioning the <hi>new</hi> Confession of Faith of the <hi>Assemblers</hi> at <hi>Westminster;</hi> I maintain that <hi>Geneva</hi> hath by this very act sufficiently declared to the World, that she disowned the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> both as to their opinions against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and their pretended <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> or <hi>Synodical</hi> Authority; For had they been of the same mind with them about Church-Government, as the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians thought it necessary to abolish that ancient Confession of our first Reformers, so the <hi>Genevans</hi> would have expunged it out of their Book. And if they had been of opinion that the <hi>two Houses</hi> of Parliament, and the <hi>Divines</hi> assembled at <hi>Westminster</hi> had had sufficient authority to make a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48913:100"/> of Faith in the name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they were obliged to insert that of the Presbyterian, into that general Collection by the very Title thereof, in which it is said, <hi>That there are contained the Confessions which have been au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically published in the name of the Reformed Churches, and approved by publick Authority.</hi> Now what can be objected against this Declaration of the Church of <hi>Geneva's</hi> approving the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her dislike of the disturbers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I protest I see not, unless it were these two things, 1. That they Reprinted the Collection of Confessions as it was in the first Edition: But it is otherwise; For they have added to it the Confession of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> as likewise that of the Reformed Churches of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> made by the general Assembly of <hi>Thoren, Anno</hi> 1645. and some others. 2. That it was out of <hi>policy,</hi> to which there needs no other answer but only this, that the said Collection of Confessions was set forth <hi>Anno</hi> 1654. in a time when the Usurpers of the Kings Authority were thought to be in a condition to say, <hi>We shall not be moved, we shall see no sorrow;</hi> and likewise the <hi>wounds</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the apprehension of most men (and it may be of the <hi>Genevans</hi> themselves) past all hopes of <hi>Cure.</hi> And yet in that very juncture, <hi>Geneva</hi> did us that right; which is a thing very worthy observation, to convince the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of their mistake, when they take it for granted, that they had the Approbation of the Reformed Churches abroad, and specially of that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in their doings here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us.</p>

This innocent and harmless custom hath been railed against by some, as being superstitious and Jesuitical, because, forsooth, the Jesuites use the same. I do not intend to put my selfe to the trouble of proving that there is in that neither Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor Jesuitisme; for it cannot be thought so, but only by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48913:100"/> weak and silly men, to say no worse of them. I mean only to inform them who are of that mind, that this very name of <hi>Jesus</hi> so abridged, is the <hi>Seal</hi> of the Reformed Church of <hi>Geneva.</hi> That City, as I observed before, is very ancient: In the time of Paganism it was consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and therefore had the Picture of the <hi>Sun</hi> (by which <hi>Apollo</hi> was represented) in great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.<note place="margin">Non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It matters not much what had been <hi>Calvin</hi>'s judgement about this particular: For, though he was a great and learned man, yet an Apostle he was not. But nevertheless I am glad that I may upon this occasion clear the then <hi>Rulers</hi> of our Church, from having had an intention to gratifie the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> any further then in Christian Charity and Prudence they were to do, when they took that Suffrage out of the <hi>Letany;</hi> to the end doubtless that such as were yet addicted to Popery, and bore still some respect to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> should not be thereby hindred from coming to Church, and from joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with us in our Prayers to God.

Observe, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> had not seen our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and that he delivers his judgement about the things contained in it, but upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation he had received from the enemies thereof: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not say (as it is falsly reported in the <hi>History of the troubles of Frankefort</hi>) that he seeth in the English <hi>Liturgy, simply</hi> and <hi>peremptorily,</hi>

And truly if they represented the English <hi>Liturgy</hi> of those times, as Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> doth that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by the same means, that of <hi>England, Calvin</hi> must be thought very moderate, that he hath said no more. So I conceive that by this time the enemies of our Book of Common Prayer see that <hi>Calvin</hi> saith but little, or rather nothing, against the same; and yet that little or nothing only upon mis-informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus much <hi>Calvin</hi> would say to excuse himself, if he were now alive, and protest withall that he never intended to pass any publick censure upon the <hi>Book</hi> which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen, but only to answer to what was represented in a private Letter, and yet that he would never have done it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if he had thought such ill use would have been made of it, as the <hi>Smectymnuans</hi> and their fore-fathers have been pleased to do since his time. And if those who would seem to yield much to <hi>Calvins</hi> Authority, would but have the same moderation as to those things which are not altogether fitted to their gust, which <hi>Calvin</hi> shewed about the use of <hi>Wafers</hi> at, and the rare receiving of, the Communion; nothing more would be demanded of them, till they were of a better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For he conformed notwithstanding his dislike of both those things, and I conceive it is not to be doubted, but he would have conformed likewise to such Ceremonies of our Liturgy, as he judged <hi>tolerable,</hi> though he had esteemed them not altogether so sit to be used. So let the <hi>Smectymnuans</hi>

It is a custom generally used in most, if not in all Parish Churches of this Kingdom, as well among <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as others, that the Clerk alone reads aloud every verse one after another, of the <hi>Psalm</hi> that is sung before and after Sermon, and that all the people sing it after him. The same was attempted and begun in some few of the Reformed Congregations of <hi>France</hi> before the year 1579.

No man, I hope, will be so much besides himself, as to think so. For, what confusions would there be in all the Churches of the World, if all such things as seem to some to be but <hi>Ineptiae,</hi> should by them be required to be omitted, and wholly laid aside by them that make another judgement of them? If so, the Ministers of <hi>France</hi> must leave wearing their <hi>Hats</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> when they Preach; Those of <hi>Basil</hi> must wear no longer their <hi>long Caps</hi> (which are just of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Sugar-loaf) when they go in the streets, but must wear <hi>Hats</hi> like other men; Those of <hi>Holland</hi> must not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise Children sprinkling them <hi>three times,</hi> but only once;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48913:105"/> In <hi>Hessen</hi> they must leave their way of singing by <hi>course,</hi> the Singers one verse, and the Organs and People another; The Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> must take another Badge than that of the name of <hi>I H S,</hi> for her Seal and Arms; The Ministers of <hi>Charenton</hi> must wear <hi>Gowns</hi> of another fashion, that which they use now seeming to many, and to some of themselves, very unfit for a <hi>Pulpit;</hi> And <hi>Calvin</hi> himselfe, if he were alive, must leave his also, and his <hi>Cap</hi> besides, to please his and their pretended friends here among us, and other persons of better humour, and more compleasant, to whom all those things may seem <hi>Ineptiae,</hi> unfit and little becoming.

And indeed 'tis great pity the Book is so little known abroad; for the more it is known, the better it is liked. The late Edition I made of it in <hi>French</hi> by His Majesties express command, having made it something more common then formerly, it was generally so well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that a new Edition of it was soon after undertaken at the charges of the Book-sellers of the Reformed Church of <hi>Paris.</hi> But the <hi>Papists</hi> having notice given them thereof, they stopped the work, seised upon the whole Impression, as much as was done of it, and fined the Book-seller. By which it is plain who are the Friends or Foes of our Book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> beyond the Seas. For let foolish or malicious cunning people say what they please of the pretended com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of our Church with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is no Reformed Church in the World, which the <hi>Pope,</hi> and with him all the wise <hi>Popish Politicians,</hi> fear and hate so much as the Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> because (amongst other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages) of her <hi>Government</hi> by <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the form of her <hi>Liturgy.</hi> For, as for the last, whereof I am to speak more specially in this place, what reason can there be imagined, why the Magistrate of <hi>Paris</hi> should rather stop the printing,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48913:105"/> and prohibit the publishing of the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> then of that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> (which is daily printed and sold there pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, as well as in other parts of <hi>France,</hi>) but that they are afraid that it would be better liked by most Christians that have either judgement, learning, or true piety, and are void of superstition, peevishness, extravagant zeal, and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, be they of what <hi>perswasion</hi> soever? They are possibly afraid, lest those of the Reformed Religion should like it so well, that they would be desirous to use it publickly in their Churches; and that if such a thing should happen, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Protestants</hi> would shortly encrease. But whatever be the reason of it, our <hi>Liturgy</hi> hath no other enemies abroad, where it is well known, but only <hi>Papists.</hi> And as for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> as many as have seen it, do either value it very much, or at least esteem it such, that they would be willing to embrace the use thereof, where it is established, judging it a madness both in the Ministers and in the people to refuse to follow the order of Prayer therein prescribed. The Reader may remember what judgement that most Illustrious and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished person the noble Princess of <hi>Turenne</hi> makes of it, in that Letter of her Highness, which I have inserted in the aforegoing Pages; where she calls it <hi>an excellent Book,</hi> and sayes, <hi>That every body is desirous to have it,</hi>

For certainly it is very observable, that at such a time, and in such a juncture of affairs our Book of Common Prayer was publickly asserted in a famous University of the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> by one of their most eminent and learnedst Divines and Professors; who doubtless would never then have attempted such a thing, if he had not had a very high esteem of that <hi>Sacred Liturgy,</hi> as he calleth it, and if he had not known that it was generally approved in the Church wherein he lived, and the <hi>Directory</hi> disliked of all men of understanding that were well acquainted with both those Books, and throughly knew what they were.</p>

                     </note> I am confident that the unpartial Readers are convinced of the Truth of the Title I give to this second <hi>Section</hi> of my present Treatise, <hi>viz. That the Reformed Church of</hi> England <hi>is not condemned by other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches,</hi> in those few things in which some of them dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from her, and she from some of them. Nay, I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say that I have done more than by that Title was by me promised, having shewed not only that the other Reformed Churches do not condemn the Church of <hi>England</hi> in those things which are not in use among them; but further, that they approve of them, and wish they had the happiness to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the same. And here let me have leave to put the case that, as it was wished by some, our Brethren of the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas were called to advise with the Divines of our Church, and to lend their helping hand to put an end to our unhappy differences. I know that it is not necessary, and that thanks be to God, we do not want lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and moderate wise men, and in all manner most capable
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48913:113"/> to help forward that so much desired settlement of our Church: But I say, put case some Divines were called from other Reformed Churches to joyn with them in that good work; put case that those Worthies, whom God was pleased to make use of in and since the first time of Reformation, to set forth the true Doctrine of the Gospel, and to maintain the same in several parts of the Christian world, were now all alive. Thereupon put case that the said Churches should be desired by the Kings most Excellent Majestie to send over their Delegates; put case that the United Provinces send <hi>Bogermannus</hi> the <hi>Praeses</hi> of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> the learned <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus de Dieu, Andreas Rivetus</hi> and <hi>Fridericus Spanhemius,</hi> both which died Ministers in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity Readers in their Universities; Put case the Reformed Churches of <hi>Franee</hi> send their beloved <hi>Peter du Moulin, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de l'Angle</hi> the Father, <hi>Monsieur Drelincourt, Monsieur Gayon, Monsieur Daillé, Monsieur Amyrant, Monsieur Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Monsieur Bochart</hi> of <hi>Caën, Monsieur Bochart</hi> of <hi>Alençon, Monsieur Vanquelin, Monsieur Martel, Monsieur Gaches, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur du Bosc, Monsieur de l'Angle</hi> the Son, <hi>Monsieur le Moine, Monsieur Morin, Monsieur Daillé</hi> the Son, <hi>Monsieur Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delet,</hi> all great and famous men, most of which have been often Delegates to their National Assemblies; Put case <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> sends <hi>Calvin, Beza, Sadeel, Danaeus, Diodati, Monsieur Chabret;</hi> The <hi>Palatinate</hi> the Reverend and most Learned <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Zanchius</hi> sometimes Professor at <hi>Hidelberg.

                  <p n="53">53. The <hi>Council</hi> thus assembled, let the questions that have been in debate amongst us for above these twenty years
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48913:114"/> last past, be propounded unto the Fathers thereof. Those Questions I conceive may be reduced to these four; 1.

Whether there must be <hi>Ʋniformity</hi> in all the particular Congregations of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very National Church. Besides these general Questions, we may ask their judgement about divers uses and customs most peculiar to this Church, which are most excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by some of our Brethren; as the <hi>Surplice,</hi> the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> upon the Childrens foreheads after they are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>kneeling</hi> at the receiving of the Communion, the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

O how truly hath he said, who said, that <hi>Order is the Soul of things.</hi> For as a body that is alive, liveth, moveth, hath sense, and performeth all its actions by means of the Soul; so that when the Soul is gone, it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and becometh a carrion, <hi>whatsoever is of any esteem and power in things well constituted, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> is by the only means of Order, &amp;c.</hi> — And so much of Order generally. Something I must adde particularly about Order Ecclesiastical, to shew you how much it hath been alwayes commended both of God himself and of all godly men, and how much the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof hath been acknowledged and cryed up. See <hi>Origen. Hom.</hi> 2. upon <hi>Num. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Chrysost. Hom.</hi> 37. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> And what need is there of quoting any more? There is none of the Ancients but doth set forth the praises of Order: And the thing speaks of it self, that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church by so much more she enjoyeth of good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by so much farther is she from being dissipated, although in the rest she be something tottering; as may be seen in the Greek and Roman Churches. So that it is a wonder that some are found in our time, who because of some abuse that hath been made of Order, have fallen into the hatred of Order it self, and would have the bonds of Order taken away, which they endeavour to do in their Churches. But really they have no more reason for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting that, than if one should be of a mind to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the props and pillars of a great house, lest those props and pillars should have too high an esteem of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to the undervaluing of the beams &amp; the other pieces
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48913:117"/> of timber, or parts of the walls. Or if one should dislike that there be so many members of several most different forms and functions, and should desire it were otherwise, lest they might have thereupon occasion of rising one above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now judge if this be a wisdom approved of God? And must we wish therefore that the body of the Church be rather like unto that of a worm, which consists of parts altogether semblable; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>elfe? For because that God hath not only disposed all things according to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, measures and weights in the work of Creation; But likewise hath filled all things therewith, when he gave order to <hi>Noah</hi> to build the Arch of the Flood; unto <hi>Moses</hi> to build the Ark of the Covenant, together with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Candlestick, &amp;c. And unto <hi>Salomon</hi> for the building up of the glorious Temple; and to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Prophet for the delineation thereof; at last he was pleased to be called the <hi>GOD</hi> of <hi>ORDER,</hi> as by an honourable name, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.) Now I pray what conclusion shall we draw out of all this, but that all such things as belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and so the Church above all other, since it is Gods in a most special manner, must be wholly replenished with Order within themselves? Let us consider the ancient Church it self, the people of <hi>Israel;</hi> Why was God pleased to <hi>divide it into twelve Tribes, and to have him march out of</hi> Egypt <hi>in a military order,</hi> (Exod. 13.18.) Why did <hi>he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe so precisely in what order they were to encamp about the Taber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>acle, and then to march, and again to pitch their Tents? Why did he command the people to be divided into bands of ten, into hundreds, and thousands, and that they should have over them each their respective Officers, Decurions, Centurions and Chiliarcks to be their Leaders and Governors? Why when he put a part one Tribe for the performance of Offices Ecclesiastical, did he divide them into the degrees of High Priests and Levites? And again the same Levites into three Orders, and the Priests by</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids <hi>means, into certain Tribes? Why did he prescribe all and every the Rites of Divine worship to the least of them?</hi> Why all
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48913:118"/> this, I say, but because the God of Order, was pleased to recommend unto our consideration the mysteries of Order that are hidden every where? Concerning the new Church, did not the Son of God conversing with us upon Earth, when he laid the foundation of the Church, lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Order therein at the same time? when of the whole multitude of the faithful he chose Seventy Disciples, and again out of them Twelve Apostles; of which twelve he adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Now when he had thus called and prepared them, did not he confirm them alone, and none other for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery? (<hi>Luk.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21.) without calling the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nay, rejecting them, when they would have intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.19, 20. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> say, that the whole Church of Christ consisting of Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Doctors, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Faithful, is one <hi>body fitly joyned together and compacted by that which every joynt supplyeth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 4.11. &amp; 16. Hence it is, that the same Apostle doth so often give commendations of Order unto the Churches, and is so zealous against the confusions that were creeping in. As when he writeth to the <hi>Colossians, Though I be absent in the Flesh, yet I am present in the Spirit, joying and beholding your Order, and the stedfastness of your Faith in Christ,</hi> c. 2. 5. And to the <hi>Thessalonians, We command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your selves from every brother that walketh disorderly, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Thes. 3.6. Out of which it is manifest, that <hi>whosoever doth praise and commend Order, and perswade unto it in any thing,</hi> (and specially in the greatest, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdom of God which is the Church) <hi>that man doth nothing else, but what God himself and all godly men do.</hi> And likewise, <hi>whosoever doth go about to disturb good Order, or to disswade from it</hi> in any thing (and specially in the greatest, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdom of God, which is the Church) <hi>doth do a thing contrary to God and all godly men:</hi> and by so doing commits an act of impiety or folly; for
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48913:118"/> which he shall be called to an exact account before God.— It is true the Church is called a <hi>Flock,</hi> and the Ministers of the Church <hi>Pastors:</hi> but not to import that it is a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly one that goes so at random, and in such a general confusion, that it matters not what sheep is to go first or last. It is called a <hi>Flock,</hi> to the end that the godly may know that God hath a care of them, that he propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture for them, and that he doth send them Leaders and Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to lead them into Salvation, and that they may rejoyce thereby. For that there must be a greater consideration of Order in the Church than in a Flock, God hath made it manifest in that he was pleased that the same Church of his should be called also, his <hi>People,</hi> his <hi>House,</hi> his <hi>City,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and his <hi>Army marching in battel.</hi> Now in all these there is a civil society, which hath several degrees whereby it is distinguished. Whence <hi>Gregory Nazianze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Order doth enjoyn and effect in the Churches, that some be Sheep, and some Pastors; that some preside, and some be subject; that one is as it were the head, another the foot, another the hand, another the eye, another some other member of the body, either superior or inferior, for the comliness and advantage of the Church. Let us reverence this Order, brethren, let us keep and maintain it.</hi> Moreover there are here two things to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; First, <hi>That all Order is from God, although every deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Order be not alwayes immediately from God, but from humane prudence.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That even those things which are of humane institution do bind the conscience, if they be not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but subordinate to Divine institution.</hi> The truth of the first proposition doth appear by the examples of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in things Civil and Ecclesiastical: As that the advice given by <hi>Jethro</hi> unto <hi>Moses,</hi> to <hi>establish Judges under him,</hi> had Gods confirmation: and that God did approve and confirm those elections which the people of <hi>Israel</hi> made of some to be Judges over them, after some heroical act of theirs: and that when <hi>David</hi> had distributed the Levites and Priests into certain ranks for orders-sake, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no otherwise, than if God himselfe had been the Author thereof, and was constantly observed as long as

Now that such things do bind the conscience, this one Text of the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> doth abundantly testifie, <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or to Governours, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. <hi>Paul</hi> hath the like; saying, that the <hi>Faithful ought to be subject to the civil Magistrate (though they were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens) not only for wrath, but for conscience sake,</hi> Rom. 13.5. Which Authority of two Apostles is a sufficient barre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rashness of men, to hinder all those that fear God and tender the peace of their conscience, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any disturbance in those things which are once right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly established.— Concerning the several degrees of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry among the <hi>Fratres Bohemi, Lasitius</hi> teacheth, <hi>c.</hi> 3. that it is not without the example of Christ, of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and the Primitive Church, that such distinct degrees are maintained in the Church. To which may be added what I said before, and that fine passage of <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi> in the Funeral Sermon of <hi>Basil</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> whom having commended for that he had alwayes been regularly advanced through the several degrees of the Church, he addes these words, I commend the Law of Seamen, by which he that intends to become a Pilot, must first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himself to rowing, next he must sit at the fore part of the ship, and after he hath rowed and observed the winds a long time, he is at last ordered to sit at the Helm. The same order is observed in military offices. First, a Souldier afterwards a Captain, and at last a General. Now that these degrees are given by order one after another, not all at once, is according to the Laws of Nature, which we are willing to keep also in those things which are wrought by Art, that we may avoid rashness and confusion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thus speaks S. <hi>Chrysostom, Homil.</hi> 5. <hi>ad Coloss. In a pair of Stairs the first step makes way to the second, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the third; neither is there any way to go from the first to the fourth, no more then it is possible to go to the second before you have passed the first. The one is the way to the other, &amp;c.</hi> As a

Hence it is that God hath put variety among the stars, <hi>So that there is one glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars: nay, one Star differeth from another star in glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.41.

For every profession or peculiar manner of living with more strictness than others, doth require likewise a peculiar Doctrine, Institution and Over-sight, as may be seen in the very study of Philosophy and Military Discipline: which <hi>Licurgus</hi> considering, he so ordered the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Sparta,</hi> as <hi>Xenophon</hi> witnesseth, that there was no rank or order in it, but had its proper and peculiar Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy. <hi>Plato</hi> likewise requireth in his Book <hi>De legibus &amp; Republicà,</hi> that by no means Citizens be suffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some power over them to keep them in order. Hence it is also that our Lord requiring his Disciples to joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and adhere each to other, in the same manner that the members of the Body are joyned and knit together, doth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48913:122"/> subject every one of his to some other, to be by them kept, moved, and governed as by members of ampler and greater power and efficacy.

                        </gap>shops they set up in all those Churches that were numerous. And they committed to the charge of every one of such Churches the neighbour Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were in lesse Towns and Villages, ordering the Priests and Curates thereof, whom they called <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> to obey all and every of them, the Bishop and Presbytery, that were nearest unto them. And those chiefest Bishops did use to call them together from time to time, with their whole Clergy, giving them instruction, and exhorting them to be careful in performing the duty of their place and calling.—Moreover they ordered that <hi>Metropolitans</hi> (these were the Bishops of the chief City in every Province) should call Synods and be the Presidents of them, wherefore they committed to these <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Bishops in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the charge of all the Churches of their Provinces; to the end that if they knew any thing to be done or order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amiss, either by the Ministers of the Churches, or the people, they might admonish them thereof in due time: and if they could not prevail to have those things mended by their admonitions, that then they should call a Synod of Bishops to see them corrected. For they had no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to exercise any jurisdiction of themselves in those Churches which had their own Bishops. For the Bishop and Presbytery of every Church had all manner of jurisdiction over the people and Clergy; and as for the Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they were judged by the Synod. Wherefore when
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48913:122"/> any were to be ordained Bishops of Churches, it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the Metropolitan, together with all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of his Province, (if that could be done with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the Churches) or with some of them, at least two or three, should resort to the Church where the new Bishop was to be ordained; there to order and direct the election of the Bishop, (if it were yet to be done) or to confirm the same, if it were made before; and to enquire with all possible exactness into the life and doctrine of the Bishop Elect; and then, lastly, after all that to consecrate him to the office of a Bishop. —Further, when the world was filled with Christian Churches, and even the Metropolitans themselves stood in need that some should take the charge of them; for when they became many in number, they had not all of them that wisdom and vigilancie which belonged to their place (there being alwayes but few that are choice and excellent in every Order of men.) The charge of a certain number of Provinces was committed to some Bishops, <hi>viz.</hi> to those of the chiefest Churches, as to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to those of <hi>Constantinople, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Alexandria,</hi> and after to the Bishop of <hi>Neocaesarea,</hi> and some others, as the exigencies of the Churches did seem to require it, according as they did grow in number and were multiplied. —At last the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the title of <hi>Ʋniversal Bishop</hi> under the Empire of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> which title the Bishops of that See did by little and little begin to abuse daily more and more, till finding an opportunity (first by the division of the Empire under <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and afterwards by the dissentions of Princes and Nations, through which they broke the power of the Emperors of the West and other Kings) they raised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to that height of Antichristian power, wherein they so much pride themselves at this day; having depressed the lawful power first of other Bishops, and afterwards of all Kings and Emperors themselves. Thus therefore was it that the Devil overthrew all wholsome Subjection and Government in the Clergy. —But being it is altogether necessary that every one of the Clergy, have their Keepers
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48913:123"/> and Governors; the Authority, power, and also the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and discipline, not only of <hi>Bishops,</hi> but likewise of <hi>Arch-deacons,</hi> and also of all others by what name soever they be called, who have any part in the over-sight and government of the Clergy, is to be restored; that so there may be none whatsoever in that Order without some Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to have an eye over him, &amp; to keep him in obedience.</q>

                     <q rend="margQuotes">That is, Now let us see how the Discipline of Ceremonies must be restored to the Churches. These are necessary Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to all Christians: the <hi>hallowing</hi> of <hi>Places</hi> for the publick administration of Christian duties: the <hi>hallowing</hi> of <hi>Times</hi> for the people to come together in the Lord for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of holy Duties; and a certain <hi>set way</hi> of administring the word and Sacraments; an Order of Discipline; holy offerings and distribution thereof unto the poor. For, first of all, it is requisite for Christians to have certain places set apart for holy Assemblies, and for the performing of such holy duties as have been enjoyned by Christ our Lord; which places ought not to be put to any other uses, unless it be upon the greatest and most urgent necessity. —An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Ceremony common to all Christians, is the <hi>Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as of <hi>certain places,</hi> so of <hi>certain times</hi> for Divine Service, It's true that God is to be celebrated and called upon by us, as at all times, so in every place of his Dominion: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that duty of ours ought to be performed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the faithful, and sometimes with greater so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, it hath seemed good to the Lord that his faithful people should have as certain places, so certain set times set apart and consecrated in a special manner for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. —And would to God that the people could but be brought to the true hallowing to Christ our Lord, and to

In which thing every Church is to be left to her own liberty, to <hi>PRESCRIBE</hi> the manner and way of holy Lessons, expounding of Scriptures, Catechisme, administration of Sacraments, Prayers and Psalms: Also of publick reprehension of sinners, of binding them to do penance, and for the Reconciliation of such as by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penance shall be found to have satisfied the Church. All which must be done in such a way as every Church may trust to be most likely to move &amp; lead her people by means of those actions unto a true and lively penitence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and advance them in the Faith of Christ. In the mean while those Churches that are of the same Nation or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, since there is not such diversity of inclinations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, it is not only comely, but also to most of them very conducible for the breeding a greater and more reverent esteem of the publick Worship of Christians, to have as much <hi>Conformity</hi> as possible in those things.</q>

The manner likewise and times of those Lessons and Prayers are agreeably constituted both to the word of God, and the practise of the ancient Church. This Ceremony therefore ought to be <hi>very religiously</hi> retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vindicated.<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <hi>12.</hi> de signo crucis.</note> The use of the Sign of the Cross, I think neither indecent nor improfitable, not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of ancient use in the Church, as that it is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and a present admonition of the <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ, if clearly understood, and religiously received, without superstition, or serving to the element or vulgar custom. —In the constitution concerning the administration of private Baptisme to sick Infants,<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <hi>15.</hi>
                        </note> all things are devoutly proposed, I wish they may be so observed: and that espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that the Baptisme of Infants be not delayed: For from thence a door is opened to the Devil for bringing in contempt upon the Church, and so upon the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Communion of Christ; which too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wish hath already obtained credit with many through the Sect of the Anabaptists.<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <hi>20.</hi>
                        </note> —The Rite of giving a <hi>Ring,</hi> or if there be any other Wedding-token which the Bridegroom would give to the Bride, either Gold or Silver; that the Bridegroom should put those things first on the Book, and from thence the Minister should restore them to the Bridegroom, that he may deliver them to the Bride, using the words prescribed in the Book: even this Ceremony, I say, seems to be very fitting, if only what all those things signifie be now and then explained to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48913:128"/> As that the Ring and the other gifts wherewith the Bridegroom will adorn the Bride, be first put upon the Book, and again delivered by the Minister to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to be given to the Bride, do signifie, that, before we use any thing that is ours, we ought to offer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate it to God whose it is, and receive it, as it were, from his hand, to employ it to his glory. So the putting of the Ring upon the Finger next the little Finger of the left Hand; in which Finger, they say, a certain Nerve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the Heart does end, and is implicated amongst the rest of the Sinews of that Finger, signifies that the Heart of the Bride ought alwayes to be bound to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom by a perpetual bond of love, as a Ring has no end. And to all these, those words are therefore added; <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> that they may think that nothing is either established betwixt themselves, or in effect good or saving, but through the singular favour and bounty of God. That likewise is very piously ordered, that the new married persons should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Sacrament together: for Christians ought not to be joyned in marriage, but in Christ the Lord. —Concerning the administration of the Sacrament to sick persons, and those things which are here commanded, they are agreeable enough to holy Scriptures; for to take the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and to eat at his Table is of no small force to comfort troubled consciences, if it be taken as the Lord did institute it. I could wish that all would communicate at the Table of the Lord every Lords day. —The Bishops only gave the Imposition of Hands, and not without reason; for whether the Covenant of the Lord is to be confirmed to those who have been baptized, or whether they are to be reconciled who have sinned more scandalously, or Ministers are to be ordained; all those Offices best become those to whom the chief care of the Church is committed. —To the <hi>Quaeres</hi> proposed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Vestments; according to my duty I answer.

Those now who are such Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may use those Habits which are in use at this day, without offending God: Now this I think that they will then do, if when by the manifest preaching of our Saviour Christ, and by the discovery and detestation of the whole Antichrist, both <hi>Roman</hi> and all other, they truly teach the people, that by using those Habits, they would not at all confirm any of those impious impostures whom the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrists have obtruded upon the people; nor that Priests are holier of themselves then other Christians; nor have more vertue to appease God; and that they do not offer (as they speak now) Christ to the Father in the Communion, and by their own work and pleasure apply his merits to any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what every one receives by his own proper Faith, from the Word and Sacraments of God: nor that <hi>Judaical</hi> Ceremonies are to be recalled; but only by it to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Kings Majesty, and those in whose power the Lord will have it to be, to appoint outward Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet such as are agreeable to the word of God; and to shun the offence of troubling publick Order and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Besides, to testifie to good men that every Creature of God is good, even by <hi>signifying;</hi> and that therefore all who truly believe in Christ may piously use these things, albeit they may be impiously abused by others. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think that either the Kings Majesty or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48913:129"/> would by the use of these Vestments, retain or cherish any thing of Superstition; but since such Habits, before the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrist, were piously used by the most holy Fathers, and that the use thereof may still serve to render the sacred Ministry and Christianity it self commendable to the younger and more ignorant sort of men, if a pious signification of them be instituted and faithfully taught; they would not by taking away those Vestments, give occasion to men of weaker faith to loath or contemne the true Ministry of Christ, or give them any suspicion, as if by a kind of irreligious levity they had delighted in overturning and abolishing all things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly used in Religion, even them of which there may remain a good use. That the people therefore ought from the sight of those Vestments to think of nothing else but heavenly purity and candor, and the ornament of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which by the sacred Ministry of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and likewise exhibited to all believers; that they should pray for that candor and ornament, both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Ministers, and that they should most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavour to acquire it, whereby they may all at length shine with the Vestments of righteousness and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. That yet it behoveth Ministers to use some Habits, and such as may not only cover and cherish their Bodies, but likewise <hi>signifie</hi> and admonish something. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath seemed good to the Kings Majesty and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that the use of those Vestments be still retained, they ought for Gods glory and the Kings honour, to turn the impious abuse of the Papists into a pious use of those Creatures of God which are good in themselves, and to declare in effect, that to holy and pure men all things are holy and pure, and truly sanctified by the Word and Prayer, and that neither Devils nor Men can so contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any Creature of God, that pious men may not use it piously and to Gods glory, even <hi>in the use of signifying, and not only in the fruition of natural effects; for all Creatures, besides the exhibition of divine bounty through natural effects, ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise many ways to admonish us of the Creator of them &amp; us, and of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48913:130"/> our gratitude towards him; to which admonitions likewise they may and ought to be publickly used.</hi> The Scriptures from which I believe I learn this opinion are now almost hinted at, to wit, those which teach that <hi>every Creature of God is good,</hi> to good men, even in signifying and admonishing: and that in no Creature of God, no abuse of wicked men can stick to the godly; that Christ the Lord hath left the free use of those things to his people; that such as the Lord hath accepted, ought to be received, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condemning their thoughts: Yet that we ought so to moderate the use of such like things, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to some comeliness, order, and edification of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9, 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Moreover that the use of them must be such as the examples of the Apostles describe, who so long used the Mosaical Ceremonies, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impiety. Concerning the other question, my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is drawn, as I believe, from sacred Scriptures, <hi>That those do at least erre, who say it is unlawful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o use those Vestments now treated of, after any manner, even after that which I have described; and they erre in that, they deny all things to be holy to those that are sanctified.</hi> The same I affirm of those who for the like cause will not use those Vestments, since their use and that not superstitious nor light, is enjoined by a publick Act of Parliament, and the consent of the Churches. For the use of those Vestments might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, as now it is in <hi>Germany,</hi> with that superstition, or so in favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> or any other Antichrist, as that they could not piously be admitted by the godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ. I confess likewise that they lessen the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates due honour, who deny that in those things, we ought to defer to their judgement. Moreover I cannot say in conscience that those Vestments are so defiled by the abuse of Antichrist, as that they ought not to be permitted to any Church, although that Church should know and maintain Christ, and the liberty of all things. —It is not in any Creature of God, in any Vestment, or Figure, or Colour, or any of Gods works to make a Rite <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,</hi> but in the mind and profession of those who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48913:130"/> the good Creatures of God to impious significations. What Scripture teacheth that such Power is given to the Devil or wicked men, that by their abuse they may be able to make any Creature of God even good by signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admonishing, ill and wicked in it self? Wherefore nothing can be truly said to be of <hi>Aarons</hi> Priesthood, as far as it is abolished. For neither is the holy Ministry of the Church, (which the precepts concerning the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> teach to be abolished) the same still, unless it may be used with that superstition, as if it were (even Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed) necessary to salvation, or profitable in it self; or that some occasion thereby be given of assuming this superstition, or of retaining it, or troubling the peace of the Brethren. So neither can a Rite be called Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, unless such a one by which you profess Antichrist and his Communion; or as it may be subservient to make such a profession and communion. Now who can deny but that God hath given to many of his chosen to make a good use of all things, not only as to their natural properties, but likewise to the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and admonitions of Gods benefits and their own duty, and not of any evil thing; And so to detest with all their soule, all whatsoever is alienate from Christ, as that no occasion at all can be given them of any superstition, or communication with darkness, or troubling that good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence which ought to be betwixt Brethren, from any thing how much soever abused by other men. If now there were many such good Christians in the world, (as there would easily be a great number of them every where, if with the pure Doctrine of Christ, his whole communion and discipline did likewise flourish) who should think that in their Churches it might conduce somewhat to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the sacred Ministry amongst the simpler sort of men and Novices, if Ministers in their Service should use some particular Habit, and even that which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists have abused, why ought I not to leave such Christians to their own Judgement? Truly I see no Scripture against it; but why I ought so to do, I have manifest Scripture
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48913:131"/> for it; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. &amp; 9. and in many other places, to wit, in all those in which we are taught concerning li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and good use of Creatures, not of meats only, but likewise of all things. It is likewise evident that our Lord Jesus Christ did prescribe to us by his own words, the substance only of the Ministry, both of the Word and Sacraments; and left to the Churches disposal all other things which pertain to the decent and profitable admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his Mysteries. Whence it is, that we celebrate the Lords Supper not in the evening, not in a private house, nor sitting, nor with men only. Who would now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Church of impiety, if by a pure and holy consent among themselves, they had that custome that every one should use a white Vestment even at the Lords Supper, as those who were newly baptized did of old? Some reckon among those things which are left to the free Ordination of the Church, likewise the administration of the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> only once a year, or three or four times, or oftner, and to be present at the Sacrament, and not to receive. But it's clear, that both these are Papistical; for it is manifest, that the Apostles and Apostolick Churches by the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, upon every Lords day, and as often as they had frequent meetings of the Brethren, did cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Lords Supper, and that all who were present did receive, &amp;c. Those two things therefore, to celebrate the Lords Supper so seldom, and so few to communicate, I judge Papistical in themselves; for they are repugnant to the word of God. But those circumstances of place, time, of the gesture of the body, pertaining to the celebration or receiving of the holy Supper, of the admitting women to the Communion of the Lords Supper, of the form of Prayers and Hymns to God, as likewise of habits and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things pertaining to external comliness, I doubt not but that the Lord hath left a free power to his Church of appointing and ordering those things, which every Church should judge chiefly to conduce amongst their own people to the upholding and encreasing of reverence towards all the holy things of God. If therefore some Churches out
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48913:131"/> this liberty of Christ, and to this end of edifying Christs people, will have their Ministers use some particular Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all superstition being removed, all levity, and all dissention among the Brethren, that is, all abuse: truly I see not who can for this matter justly condemn such Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of any sin, much less of communion with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. For, if any one should maintain that this liberty ought not to be permitted to any Church of Christ, truly he must acknowledge one of these; Either that no power is given to the Church to order any thing concerning the <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that is not expresly commanded of <hi>Christ;</hi> by which means all <hi>Churches</hi> shal be condemned of impious boldness. For, all of them observe both time, and place, and gesture of body in the celebration of the holy Supper, (as seems best to them) and admit Women to the Communion: of all which things they have not only no command of the Lord, but likewise a contrary example. For, he did celebrate his Supper in the evening, not in the morning; in a private house, not in a publick; sitting with his Disciples, and having taken the Paschal Supper, not standing; and exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this only Communion of himselfe: and, lastly, without any Women being present, who notwithstanding were amongst the most holy of his Disciples. Or, that it is not possible that there be such Churches which the Lord hath so farre delivered from all superstition, and abuse of his good creatures, as that to no men who are pure through true Faith in his name, all the creatures of God should be good, and pure even in the use of signification; the which, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever doth affirm, that man truly even in that, denies that Christ the Lord is to all men that which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be unto all, to wit, the deliverer from all uncleanness. Or that the wicked by their abusing of things can so defile the creatures of God which are good of themselvs, that they can serve no pious man to a pious use; which is apparently contrary to the testimony of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. &amp; 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Or truly that it is not lawful for Christians to make use of all things, both to admonish us of their and our Creator, and of his benefits towards us,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48913:132"/> and our duties towards him; which is repugnant to that which the Holy Ghost teacheth in divers places, where he speaks of acknowledging and worshipping of God in all his works, and doing all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father.</q>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">All these things which are absurd to pious minds, ought to be shun'd; nor is that evil to be feared which usually is objected: If so great a libertie be granted to Churches, that they may use all things whatsoever, even to pious significations and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions: there will be some who may bring into our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship of God, all the Rites of <hi>Aaron</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrist, or the Heathen: for the Churches which I have described, &amp; to whom I think that libertie of which I treat cannot be denied; will so moderate any thing of Rites or Vestments which they shall take for their use, that they may serve to set forth, not obscure the Gospel of Christ; as is observed among all true Christians, in all such exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rites as are not expresly commanded of the Lord. The chiefest end of Rites is the commending and adorning of the Ministry of the Gospel, by which all superstition and abuses of every thing are driven away. Whether we will or not, we must confess, that differences of Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in those who bare Civil Offices among well-ordered men, do beget singular reverence towards the Magistrates. What should now let, but the same may be in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie of Religion? 'Tis true, every pious motion of the mind does necessarily come from the holy Spirit, and it must needs be upheld by the Word of God: but yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Creatures amongst pious men is repugnant to this Spirit, and this Word of God; and so much the less if the thing by publick Institution be designed to some pious signification and admonition: for God hath fram'd all his works, and doth preserve this manifold use of them for the good of the godly, and he affords them that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to make use of them for his glory. Let us consider what the Holy Ghost teacheth concerning the signification of the Womans Vaile, and of the uncovering of mans head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. For why did he expresly make mention
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48913:132"/> of the bright garments of the Angels? for he doth nothing rashly, and by all things he procures the salvation of his own, which consists in the Faith of the Gospel.</q>

                     <q rend="margQuotes">If we go on to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade these indifferent things as pernicious and impious, then shall we condemn very many Churches that are no enemies to the truth of the Gospel, and rebuke too sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an infinite number of those which anciently were reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned amongst the most famous. I am not ignorant that the authority of the Church of either present or passed times, is not to be of such force, as to endamage the truth of Gods word; For that truth is to remain stable and unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if the world it self should be overthrown. But I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly affirm that we must not condemn the <hi>Church,</hi> or speak of her unbeseemingly meerly for indifferent things. And because I see you think that these things are in no wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, it may be useful to weigh now the Reasons by which you are so perswaded. Wherefore to abridge, as you do, I will reduce them chiefly to two heads. First, you say that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Priesthood is not to be called back, unto which this difference of Habits seems to belong. For having Christ for our Priest, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Ceremonies are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated, neithet can they with good Conscience be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called or revived. The other ground of your Reasons is, That they are invented by Antichrist, and since we ought not only to be alienated from the Pope, but also from all his devices, you would have us also to cast away the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and ornaments of his Ministers. Since these be your two chiefest Batteries, let us first take them into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: then will I add the other things if my memorie can suggest me any, that have been said by you for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48913:135"/> of your opinion. There were in the Law or <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Priesthood, Sacraments, by which God was pleased to confirm the promises of Christs coming, all which, I know, are abrogated; and we must believe a Christ that is come already, and not one who is to come. And since we have other seals of Gods promises given us under the Gospel by our Lord himself, I mean Bread, Wine and Water, we ought not to call back the ancient tokens. There were notwithstanding some actions in the old Law, of such a nature, that they could not be called properly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for they were for Decency, for Order, and some conveniencie, the which agreeing to the light of nature and bringing us some advantage, I am of opinion that they may be both restored and observed. Who seeth not that the Apostles bid the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for peace-sake, and the easier living together of the faithful, that they should abstain from blood and things strangled. These things, question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, were Jewish, if you will generally comprehend all the things that were in the Law. None of us is ignorant that at this day the Tithes also are appointed in innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places, for the maintenance of the Ministers of the Church. You cannot easily shew out of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the use of singing of Psalmes and Hymnes in the Church, which clearly appears to have been done under the Old Testament. Not to speak of what <hi>Ambrosius</hi> plainly saies, interpreting the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> at the fourteenth Chapter, that the custom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh there, was taken from the Syn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gogue, and transferred to our Churches. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if I would look and consider with more diligence, which my leasure does not give me leave to do, I could find not a few things that our Church hath borrowed from <hi>Moses,</hi> and that even from the very beginning. And not to omit it, we have Holy daies in remembrance of Christs Resurrection, Nativitie, Pentecost, and Christs death; must we abolish them all, because they are marks of the Old Law? From all these things I believe you now see that all belonging to <hi>Aarons</hi> Priesthood are not so abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48913:136"/> that nothing of it may be retained or commonly used. Neither do I think it a sufficient answer for you to say, that so the door will be open to all abuses. Holy water, Incense, and a number infinite of that kind. For, your adversaries will answer, that there a certain measure of those things which they re-establish and keep, must be fixed, so that the Church be not burdened with those kind of things; neither must they be accounted of as being the Worship of God, or the power of Religion; which we see done of Holy Water and Incense. Lastly, we must take heed lest Christian libertie be endangered, so that if some be restored, it must not be upon the account of their being necessary to salvation, But things of this kind must be so tolerated, as that they be put aside when they appear to be of less use, as I said even now, it seemed fit to me it should be done at this time about the different Habits. For I would have had them laid aside, but since it did not succeed, I have resolved to bear with them until we may have something better. Would to God the Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> could redeem their former libertie with this one damage, though I wish by any means nothing superfluous may be obtruded upon them. But let us now weigh the other Argument, by which the use of these Vestments seems not to be lawful, <hi>viz. Because they have been invented by the Popes tyranny.</hi> I do not see here upon what ground it can be said, that we cannot do any of those things which use to be done amongst the Papists. Truly we must take heed lest we should keep the Church of Christ under too great a slavery, so that she may use nothing that did belong to the Pope. Certainly our Ancestors have received the Temples of the Idols, and converted them into holy Churches, therein to have Christ worshipped; and took the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue consecrated to the Gods of the Gentiles, Stage-playes, and the Vestal Nuns, for the maintenance of the Ministers of the Church, whereas these things did not belong only to Antichrist, but to the Devil himself. And also Verses of Poets which were dedicated to the <hi>Muses</hi> and divers of the Gods; or used at Playes upon the Stage to appease the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48913:136"/> Gods, the Ecclesiastical Writers have made use of when they were fit and true, and to the purpose; and that after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Apostle, who did not scorn to cite <hi>Menander, Aratus,</hi> and <hi>Epimenides.</hi> And that in holy Scripture it self, which he delivered, and hath fitted those words, which otherwaies were prophane, to the worship of God. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, it may be, you would say, that those his words set out in holy Scripture do not so much belong to the worship of God, as the visible words which pertain to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Moreover, who knows not that Wine was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> Bread to <hi>Ceres,</hi> Water to <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Olive-tree to <hi>Minerva,</hi> Learning to <hi>Mercury,</hi> Singing to the <hi>Muses</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> and many other of the same kinde may you find in <hi>Tertullian De Corona militis,</hi> wherein he handles almost the same Argument; which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we fear not to employ freely as well in sacred as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane uses, though they have been dedicated either to Devils or Idols? Neither do I so easily grant that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of Vestments have had their beginning from the Pope, since we read in the Ecclesiastical History, that <hi>John</hi> the Apostle wore a thin Plate or Bishops Mitre. And <hi>Pontius Diaconus</hi> witnesseth of <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Martyr, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be put to death, he gave his upper thick coat to the Executioner, his Priests habit called <hi>Dalmatica,</hi> which was a kind of white garment, to the <hi>Deacons,</hi> and remained in his under linnen cloaths. Besides, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the white Garment of the Ministers of the Church. And the Ancients witness, that after Christians had made profession of Christ, they did change their Garments, and instead of a Gown took a Cloak. For which Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laught at by the Pagans, <hi>Tertullian</hi> did write a most learned Book <hi>De Pallio.</hi> And I believe you know how they gave a white Garment to them that were initiated by Baptisme. It appears then, that there was some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Vestments in the Church before the Popes tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But be it so, suppose them to have been invented by the Pope, I cannot perswade my self the impiety of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery to be such, as that it should defile and pollute every
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48913:137"/> thing it comes near to; so that it cannot be turned to a good use by good and pious men. I believe you now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand my meaning concerning either Jewish or Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l Ceremonies, whether to be established or continued. Wherfore having observed briefly in this manner what was to be answered to the two chiefest heads of your Reasons, I come now to that which your self confess, that all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions are not to be condemned; For, it is an humane invention to receive the <hi>holy Communion</hi> in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather then after dinner. And it was an humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention that the price of things sold in the Primitive Church, should be laid at the Apostles feet. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with you those Vestments to be an invention of men, and that in themselves they do not edifie. But some will think fit, that they be tolerated for a time; For, they may be the cause to avoid those contentions by which greater and more considerable Conveniences could be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and so hinder mens minds from being suddenly averse from the Gospel as we see it every day. I omit that those who defend them may pretend some good and reasonable signification, not unknown to Scripture. The Ministers of the Church are Gods Angels and Messengers, witness <hi>Malachy;</hi> and Angels have almost alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in white Garments. How can we deprive the Church of that freedom, that it should not be lawful for her t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> signifie something by her Actions and Rites, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided she does not make the Worship of God to consist in such things that she uses moderation, and have but few; that Christs people be not burthened with Ceremonies, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things hindred? If you say that Ministers should be Angels, and not represent them: I hear it. But the same might have been answered to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he prescribed to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the Woman should be covered, and the man uncovered, for he doth urge nothing besides the signification. For, some of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> might have answered him, Let the Man behave himself as the head of the Woman, and the Woman shew her self subject to man by their deeds and life, and let them not endeavour
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48913:137"/> to declare it by signs. But the Apostle saw it was useful not only to live uprightly, but also that we should be put in mind of our duty by words and signs. If from hence occasion of erring is given to the weak, they must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to believe these things indifferent, they must be taught in Sermons not to put Gods worship in them. Whether the eyes of the beholders will be averted by the difference of Vestments, from serious things, is a thing which perhaps all will not think true; For, first, your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries may answer that it will not happen if the Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they use be without superfluity, and very plain, and such as hitherto have been used in the time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: for custom and usefulness take away admiration. But it may be they will answer also, that it is likely that they being affected with that admiration, they will have a greater attention to things that are serious, to which end the outward signs in the <hi>Sacraments</hi> seem to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, that by the very sight and feeling of them we might be led to the meditation of heavenly things. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think when any thing which of it selfe is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, is taken in to be used in the Church, and is constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed by many, that by the same means a tyranny is brought into the Church. We now so administer the Lords Supper in the morning, that we would not have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Church in the afternoon. But who will say, that that thing is tyrannical which we all do alike with one consent? As for me, as I have often said already, I would like it better that we should do nothing but what Christ hath done and commanded the Apostles. But if any things indifferent have been added, I would not now too hotly dispute thereupon, specially since we see them, by whose means the light of the Gospel hath been much, and may yet be more promoted in <hi>England,</hi> to be our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites. I do acknowledge with you that whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin; but that which is written by the Apostle to <hi>Titus, All things are clean to them that are clean,</hi> is that which makes chiefly for the quieting of our consciences in those things we do: and so that to <hi>Timothy, Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48913:138"/> of God is good.</hi> For it is not required of necessity that every one of those things we do, be expresly mentioned in holy Scripture; It is enough to know by Faith generally, that things indifferent cannot defile those that are sincerely minded and have a good conscience.</q>

But therein some conditions ought by all means to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; First of all, and chiefly, that such Ordinances be not contrary to the word of God.

Ergo in Ecclesia, quae est Fidelium societas, &amp; in quâ multae res aguntur, eaequi Divinae &amp; celestes, haec duo necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria sunt, nempe politia &amp; ritus propter concordiam &amp; honestatem alendam &amp; retinendam. Quia Ecclesiae &amp; sine concordia nullae sunt prorsus: Et bene composita rerum omnium constitutione optimè sustinentur. Concordia autem &amp; honestas sive ordo in Ecclesia ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari non potest, nec decenter omnia &amp; secundum ordinem fieri pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt, ut jubet Paulus, nisi addantur leges &amp; traditiones sive obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationes, quibus tamquam vinculis quibusdam ordo ipse &amp; decorum consistat. Quod ex eo patet, quod cum in hominum moribus tanta insit diversitas, tanta in animis varietas, tanta in judiciis ingeniis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que pugna; neque politia ulla satis, firma est nisi certis legibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituta, nec sine stata quadam forma servari ritus quispiam potest.</hi>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">Because, saith he, that if in every society of men some Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is necessary for the preserving of publick Peace, and maintaining of Concord; and if in all things that are done, some Rite also belonging to publick Decency and so to Humanity it self, is likewise necessary: It follows that these two things, Polity and Rites, are necessary in the Church, which is the Society of the Faithful, and in which there are many things done, and those Divine and heavenly, for the preserving and maintaining of Concord and Decency. For they are not Churches at all wherein there is no Concord; and all Churches are best preserved and upheld by a well ordered constitution of all things. Now Concord and Decency, or Order cannot be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church, nor <hi>all things be done decently and in order,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth, without the addition of some Laws and Traditions or Observations, whereof, as it were, by so many bonds, Order it self and Decency are constituted and made to stand.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48913:142"/> such diversity in the manners of men, such variety of minds, such contrariety of judgements and dispositions, no Polity can stand firmly enough, unless it be constituted by certain Laws; neither is it possible that any Rite be observed without some certain <hi>set form.</hi>

                     <q rend="margQuotes">Because, saith he, God was not pleased to prescribe every particular thing that we ought to follow, as to external Discipline and Ceremonies; and that because he foresaw that such things must depend on the various condition of times, and that the same form would not agree with all ages.

But yet, though there were now some absurdity to use such Rites, because they are not fitted for these times; he would not by any means that those who are accustomed to them, should be forced to leave them against their will, because they are things of their nature indifferent, and that the peace of the Church must never be troubled for such things, though they had been instituted without any necessity, and were not without some inconveniencie.</q>

And surely it must be by so much more at the liberty of every Church to enjoy her own rite and custom, that neither Christ nor the Apostles have commanded any thing expresly about the same. True it is that our Saviour hath commanded we should use Bread and Wine at his Supper, and that we should eat and drink in remembrance of him.

But at such a time as this, no man will be able to perswade them to it. When we began the Reformation of Churches, we considered what things were most profitable to the weak people, and what the tenderer sort were best able to bear without loss of the truth. But this we had a special care of, that although we did not agree with those of <hi>Zurich</hi> or <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> yet living in charity with strangers, we that are of the same City, and Subjects to the same Government, might use but one and the same Rite. Your condition does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you now to differ in Rites, since it is reported that there are other Sects amongst you. Nothing can be more convenient, than to agree all in one certain <hi>set form.</hi> We do not intend to draw you to observe wholly our Ceremonies; neither will we send you to those of <hi>Zurich</hi> or <hi>Berne.</hi> But
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48913:156"/> there is nothing more useful for you than <hi>Ʋniformity.</hi> Doth Religion consist in a golden or wooden Cup? Or in this that the mystical signs be given or taken out of a paten of silver or glass? Hath Christ more regard to them that <hi>sit,</hi> or <hi>stand,</hi> or <hi>kneel?</hi> Hath he the less, who receives the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with his own, or with anothers hand? O our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, if we live in such calamitous times, after the light of the Gospel hath shined so brightly, we so much tye our selves to rudiments, and forget our liberty, how to use the same for the advantage of our neighbours. Surely when out of ostentation a singular Rite is sought after, and the common way of Brethren is forsaken, it were better mean while to be without the Communion. Wherefore if the Lord giveth you to agree, and that if there be mention made of the Rite of receiving the Communion, because you live under the same Lords, and make, as it were, one Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese, I beseech you to do what you can, that there be no <hi>variety</hi> amongst you. Secondly, you must alwayes take heed that the Sacraments do not come to be slighted; which is a very dangerous thing. There will never be Unity where the Sacraments of Unity are little valued. If you neglect to agree amongst your selves, lo I do not see what agreement you will be able to keep with us.</q> Thus <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> to the Ministers of the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Soleurre,</hi> that were upon setling of Religion among themselves, and whose condition resembled altogether that of <hi>England</hi> at this time, being much troubled with <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and other Sects. So that their case and ours being alike, do but change the names, and you see what is to be done amongst us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his advice, for the peace of this Church in the present juncture.</p>

                  <p>ANd now I have made good (as I conceive it will be be granted on all hands) that the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> is not condemned by the other Reformed Churches,<note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> whether for her Government or Publick Worship, which is that I engaged to prove in my second <hi>Section;</hi> it is time I should draw to a conclusion, and end this Treatise. I said in the beginning, I chiefly intended thereby to undeceive all those of what perswasion soever, who thought the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas were great Strangers, and as great Enemies to all such things as are here disliked by some in the Nation. And I made two branches of those mis-informed persons, <hi>viz.</hi> Those that are true and obedient Sons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and those that for these many years last past have vilified, and, I may say, renounced her (though their own tender Mother, in whose womb they were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48913:168"/> to Christ) because they were not pleased with the manner of her dress and tune of her voice, and such like things. For the first I have little or nothing to say to them, nothing doubting but that they are glad of the information they have had in the foregoing pages. They see their friends abroad are not only in greater numbers, but likewise far more kind, then some would have made them to believe they were; for which, all that is required of them, is onely this, that they be thankful to God for it, and that they requite the kindness of those our Brethren with a reciprocal love on their part. As for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch, they are not all of one sort; some having been deceived by others, some having deceived themselves, some having been deceivers both of others and of themselves, and some (though I will charitably suppose these are but few in number) meer Deceivers of others. For this last kind of men, I shall say nothing to them, because I have here brought in nothing but what they knew a long time since as well as my self. Only I beseech Almighty God, who is the onely searcher of hearts, and who alone consequently knows who they are, that he would be pleased to turn their hearts, and take away from them their deceitfulness. But as for you the rest of my deceived Brethren, whether by others, or by your selves, give me leave to direct my speech to you, and to present unto all of you a <hi>Petition for Peace,</hi> instead of that (so named) by some of you presented to some of the Right Reverend Bishops and other Reverend Divines. If you are Christians, as you profess your selves to be, and charity bindeth to believe you are, such a motion cannot but be very welcome to you. God is the <hi>God of Peace;</hi> Christ is the <hi>Prince of Peace;</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> is the legacy he left his Disciples when he was departing out of this World. It was your opinion, that there was no other means of Peace in this Church, but by leaving every Minister to follow his own way in the publick worship of God, as to the manner and circumstances thereof. The Parliament <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> after a long debate, hath been of another mind, and hath solemnly declared by a Publick <hi>Act,</hi> that the so much desired Peace and Unity of the Church cannot be attained by any other
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48913:168"/> means but <hi>Ʋniformity,</hi> which is therefore commanded unto all, with Penalties decreed against every one that shall not submit and conform to the prescribed Orders of the Church. My earnest request to you is, that for <hi>Peace, for Gods sake, you subject your selves to this Ordinance of man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> as you are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do by the Apostle. I know the same Apostle sayes, that <hi>we ought rather to obey God then men.</hi>

But take heed you do not ascribe to God such things as he never acknowledged for his, taking your own private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his Laws, which is the greatest usurpation of Gods Authority, and in a manner to make your selves your own Gods.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48913:173"/> the Peace of the Church against the said <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators;</hi> And I heartily wish that whatever be the pretenses of those that have been the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Church upon the same account, may not be found (some of them) to have the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions with them in <hi>Polonia.</hi>

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48913:174"/> the propagation of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that we should be joyned together as members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not only by one Faith and Confession, by one doctrine and knowledge, by one bond of Charity and Holiness of life; but likewise mutually amongst our selves, by Concord and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the <hi>worship</hi> of God.</p>
                              <p>To this very thing God seems to lead us by the hand in his word, when in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he enjoyns the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the instituted Ceremonies; And of the New he maketh promise:<note place="margin">Jer. 32.39.</note>
                                 <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.</hi> Which very thing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle requireth of us in these words:<note place="margin">Rom. 15 5, 6.</note>
                                 <hi>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one towards another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ Jesus: that ye may with</hi> one mind, <hi>and</hi> one mouth <hi>glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>

                              <p>Moreover the example of the Captain himself,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> the Perfecter of Faith, and Prince of Life, our Lord Jesus Christ (every action of whom is our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) does clearly demonstrate the same unto us.<note place="margin">Act. 13.15.</note> For there came to Christ on a time (as

                                 <hi>Lord teach us to pray, as</hi> John <hi>also taught his Disciples to pray: and he said unto them, when ye pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> Could not the Lord Christ have taught them how to pray in other words, albeit he had not given them that form <hi>verbatim, Say so, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> but that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ʋniformity</hi> of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and <hi>Ʋnity</hi> in praising God?

It may also be obvious to every one, almost by all Circumstances, that the whole divine worship was uniformly administred in the Ancient Church.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48913:176"/> of <hi>Lithuania</hi> held at <hi>Orlen, Anno</hi> 1633. and at <hi>Wlodavia, Anno</hi> 1634. to ordain with an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous consent, that out of all the three <hi>Provinces,</hi> to wit, out of the <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Lesse Polonia,</hi> and the <hi>Great Dukedom</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania,</hi> Ritual Books of all kindes being diligently sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, one should be composed, which should be constantly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in all Churches which are in the Dominions belonging to the Kings sacred Majesty. Which truly is now perfected according to the pious desires of all the Faithful in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For if those said Ritual Books be diligently looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and compared one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, it wil be certainly found, that they differ only somewhat in words and order, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and in fundamentals, they are consonant to Faith. Hence the amendments are nothing else but in some places a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of prolixity, in other, an amplification of brevity, a co-ordination of holy Prayers, and a reducing of all into order. In some places we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that which might be said with greater edification, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and devotion; and what was wanting (as to occasional Rites, concerning Ecclesiastical Discipline, Divorces, &amp;c.) we
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48913:177"/> have added by mutual consent, according to the practise of the Church, that in every thing all persons might be satisfi'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is a thing impossible.

For what more acceptable harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can be given, then when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, and every one in his Mothers tongue do praise God with one affection of heart?

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48913:178"/> subtilely to introduce a licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness into the house of God: and they do this, by biting the good, received, and uniforme Order; and by obtruding upon the Church, instead of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, I know not what private ones, which yet they will needs defend by their pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inconsiderable Arguments. For they say, First, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster can preach the word of God with a ready memory; wherefore then ought he not, besides the common and set Prayers, conceive others in his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>art and mind, and according to his pleasure frame them to himself and utter them? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Prayers which proceed from the heart are more devout than those which are read out of a Book; why then ought not the Minister to pray according to his own conception and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
                              <p>The Answer to the first is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand; For the question is not, whether the Minister can or cannot utter in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation a Prayer conceived in his heart: for, we know that God hath poured out the Spirit of Grace and Prayer upon his faithful servants.<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10. Act. 2.17.</note> But here the main question is, whether every Minister should be suffered to obtrude his own Prayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48913:178"/> by himself, known to no body, and unaccustomed to the Church, instead of those which are conceived with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation by the servants of Christ, perused by the <hi>Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> of the Church, and approv'd of by the Synod? Which liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty why we do not grant, we have these Reasons. <hi>First,</hi> it is the will of Christ, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful being gathered together, should pray in the same words, as is observed before, out of these words, <hi>But you pray after this manner, Our Father,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Mat. 6.9.</note>
                                 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he openly shews both the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers:</hi> and teaches that God ought to be called upon and worshipped in the same words. Wherefore there is no doubt but that Minister ought to be judged an opposer of this, who that he may get a little vain-glory, not led thereunto by any ground of Religion, prayes in other words then the people of God use to pray. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Christ admonisheth, that all who pray should agree about those things they desire to ask in these words,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.9.</note>
                                 <hi>If two of you should agree on earth of one thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> But such a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher does not agree with the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48913:179"/> Faithful in the same thing, whilest he asketh another thing than what they thought he would ask, and instead of the usual Prayers, introduceth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, different from those both in manner and order. Thence it comes, that the auditors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, hearing unaccustomed Prayers do confound their own mind and devotion, whilest they rather give ear to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the Prayers, than they do imitate the Pastor: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they often desire to follow, yet they do not hear, or do not understand; or for the novelty of the words they linger in their devotion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Prayers of the whole Church are a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice acceptable to God, in the New Testament substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the room of the legal sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.<note place="margin">Act. 1.14. Psal. 51.17.</note> And as the sacrifices were offered by all equally and uniformly, and in them the same Rites and Ceremonies were observed by the Priests: In like manner ought our sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the New Testament to be offered by all with one voice and one heart, without any difficulty, when (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle admonisheth) we offer unto God our reasonable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.15.</note> From hence it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently be gathered, that the nature of preaching and prayer
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48913:179"/> is different: for because the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Gods word ought to preach the Gospel, considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being had of time and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom it behoveth him to exhort and reprove in the name of Christ, he cannot be tied to certain forms of speaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he performs an Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from God to the people; but when he does that Office from the people to God (as he doth in prayer) then he is tied to words and things, yea, to thoughts themselves according to that of <hi>Luke,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Act. 1.14.</note>
                                 <hi>all of them did continue with one mind in prayers and supplications:</hi> and no wonder, <hi>for those worshippers of God had one heart and one mind.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The other Argument is of no force; a Prayer (say those <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators</hi>) proceeding from the heart, is more fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, than that which is read out of a Book: Those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Comforters take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that prayer and devotion which is of God,<note place="margin">James 1.17.</note>
                                 <hi>proceedeeh from the Father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect gift commeth down from above:</hi> which God himselfe witnesseth in that promise, saying, <hi>I will pour upon the house of</hi> David <hi>the spirit of grace and prayer.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> Now whilest he poureth out the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer, without doubt
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48913:180"/> Prayers are with Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                              <p>Besides, O you Minister, it is left at your liberty to do what you please with your own private Prayer; but for those which belong to all the people, you have not so much power as that you may alter them. For these are of publick right, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately delivered by the Church with the consent of all. And none of the Faithful is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of missing the sense, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Common Prayers have been under the examination of many, and that they are now frequent in the hands and mouths of all: It is otherwise, when one speaks to God in the name of all, in unusual words, and which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the most part.</p>
                              <p>But most beloved Brethren, that sort of men do pretend one thing and intend another,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.20.</note> you may know them by their fruit. but this is deservedly reckoned amongst the chiefest fruits of this Doctrine of the <hi>Innovators,</hi> (whom we hold for professed enemies to Christ.) For they say, the invocation of Christ is no where enjoyned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; wherefore it is lawful to pray or not to pray to him. The other is this, Christ is not
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48913:180"/> the adequate object of our prayer, or the <hi>Terminus</hi> to which prayer is directed, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, to whom we pray through Christ. The third is, the Holy Ghost ought not to be prayed unto, because it is the gift of God. We pass by the rest. That then these men may lurk the more securely, and call neither upon Christ nor the Holy Ghost, they do therefore contemn <hi>set Forms,</hi> and in their place put those of their own framing, which they say by heart. Which being an injury offered to the holy Trinity, it deservedly ought to be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by all the Faithful: and if such kind of men be any where found amongst us, they are certainly to be suspected in matter of Faith, being indeed such as will not persist with us in unity and charity, not remembring that most weighty exhortation of the Apostle, saying,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.10.</note>
                                 <hi>Now I beseech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgement. Wherefore, Beloved,</hi>

                                 <hi>believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false Prophets are
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48913:181"/> gone out into the world. Hereby know you the spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God.</hi> Yea, study not to please them by any means, neither do you imitate their worship or works, being certainly perswaded, that they are enemies to the Cross of Christ, who love not the Son of God, esteeming it better to draw upon them that horrible <hi>Maranatha,</hi>

In the year 1651. that great and good man, My Lord Primate <hi>Ʋsher</hi> told me that the learned Mr. <hi>David Blondel</hi> had concluded his <hi>Apologia pro Hieronymo</hi> with words to this purpose. <hi>By all that we have said to assert the Rights of the Presbytery, we do not intend to invalid the ancient and Apostolical Constitution of Episcopal Preheminence. But we believe that wheresoever it is established conformably to the ancient Canons it must be carefully preserved, and wheresoever by some heat of contention or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it hath been put down or violated, it ought to be reverently restored.</hi> The good Primate told me besides, that whereas
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48913:183"/> the Book had been written at the earnest request of the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> especially, who had their Agents and Leagers in <hi>Paris</hi> to strengthen their party by mis-informing the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> and winning them to their side. When these Agents saw this conclusion of Mr. <hi>Blondels</hi> Manuscript they expostulated with him very lowd for marring all the good he had done in his Book, disappointing the expectation of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself an enemy instead of a friend to their holy Covenant. This they urged upon him with such vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and unwearied importunity, that they prevailed with him to put out that conclusion. Having received that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from a person of so much knowledge and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as that famous Prelate, yet for a further Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I told it to Mr. <hi>John Blondel (Davids</hi> Brother) then living in <hi>London,</hi> who denied that there was any truth in that Report, and defended his Brother as much wronged by it. If you think (said I) that I wrong your Brother, complain to him of me in your next Letter, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my kind service to him. Mr. <hi>John Blondel</hi> did not fail to write to his Brother about this. And three or four weeks after shewed me a letter from him, wherein he remembred his love to me, and acknowledged that the Relation was true.</p>
                     <p>This Advice I thought my selfe obliged to give you, knowing that no man can make a better use of it than your self, to whose holy labours about this point, the Church is so much indebted, and none more your debtor in the Church in that regard then,</p>

            <p>When Doctor <hi>Basire</hi> was at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the <hi>Geneva</hi> men that use to trade in that City, knowing that he had the use of the French Language, being a French man born, desired him that by his means they might at some times assemble together to worship God, in the house of the Lord Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of <hi>England.</hi> The Reverend and pious Doctor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord Embassadors consent, yielded them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and because he had no Book of Common Prayer in <hi>French,</hi> he translated out of it as much as needed for those Offices which he was to perform with them, <hi>viz.</hi> Morning and Evening Prayer, and the Offices for Infants Baptisme, and for the Communion, which he ministred to them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Order of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Which when the Ministers of <hi>Geneva</hi> had heard they exhorted their men, that by all means they would improve that favourable means of performing Church Duties, which the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God so unexpectedly had afforded them; and gave Doctor <hi>Basire</hi> many thanks. This is the Extract of one of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Minister's Letters, which the Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath imparted and consented to have published, though with much reluctancy; the others are to the same purpose. It was Penn'd by <hi>Monsieur Leger</hi> in the name of his Brethren as well as his own.</p>
